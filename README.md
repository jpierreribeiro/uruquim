# Uruquim

*A web framework for the Joy of Programming.*

An Odin microframework for real-world JSON APIs.

**Simple by default, explicit when needed, data-oriented underneath.**

**Positioning:** internally data-oriented and allocator-aware; externally simple,
productive, and predictable — for humans and for AI coding agents. No code
generator, no mandatory CLI, no heavy metaprogramming: ergonomics come from
extractors and canonical helpers.

Uruquim is built on three equally important commitments:

```text
Performance
    + memory correctness
    + predictable hot path

Productivity
    + safe defaults
    + simple CRUD
    + few mandatory concepts

AI readability
    + canonical API
    + compiling examples
    + no aliases, no magic
```

The target experience:

<!-- fragment: phase1/readme-taste -->
```odin
package main

import web "uruquim:web"

User :: struct {
	id:   int    `json:"id"`,
	name: string `json:"name"`,
}

main :: proc() {
	app := web.app()
	defer web.destroy(&app)

	web.get(&app, "/users/:id", get_user)

	web.serve(&app, 8080)
}

get_user :: proc(ctx: ^web.Context) {
	id, ok := web.path_int(ctx, "id")
	if !ok {
		return
	}

	web.ok(ctx, User{id = id, name = "Jean"})
}
```

No allocator configuration, no transport selection, no manual context assembly.
The systems-level machinery exists — it lives behind the API, available through
an explicit advanced surface when needed.

## Transport direction

The future Odin `core:net/http` (expected to build on `core:nbio`) is the
desired canonical transport backend if and when its real API is available and
validated. Uruquim initially uses `laytan/odin-http` strictly behind an
internal adapter. No public Uruquim API exposes transport types, so migration
is confined to the adapter and conformance work; its difficulty is not assumed.

## Status

Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4 are complete: implementation finished, public contracts
frozen behind a gate. What "frozen" means, symbol by symbol and with the
evidence behind each one, is recorded in
[`planning/phase-1-freeze.md`](planning/phase-1-freeze.md),
[`planning/phase-2-freeze.md`](planning/phase-2-freeze.md) and
[`planning/phase-3-freeze.md`](planning/phase-3-freeze.md) — the Phase-2 freeze
covers not only the API but the project's claims, lifetimes and capacities, and
the Phase-3 freeze **amends** those three ledgers rather than appending to them.

**Phase 3 replaced the router wholesale and cost six public symbols.** Nine of
its work packages — the benchmark harness, the allocation audit, the
representation shootout, the radix index, registration conflict diagnostics, the
path policy, automatic HEAD and OPTIONS, multi-parameter routes and the arena
decision — shipped **zero public surface between them**. At 5,000 routes,
dispatch went from 883 µs to about 1.7 µs and is now **flat**: it costs the same
at 5 routes as at 5,000. The six symbols are `route`, `app_with_state`, `state`,
`Limits`, `DEFAULT_LIMITS` and `limits`.

**Phase 4 (production) shipped five symbols and closed two of the three
deficiencies it opened with.** Read/write request deadlines (slowloris was a
real, demonstrated hole), bounded admission with a shutdown reservation, `stop`,
trusted proxies, security headers and an observable drop policy — most of them
as FIELDS on a struct that already existed, which is why five names covered
seven capabilities. `planning/phase-4-freeze.md` records it, including what was
NOT delivered and why.

**It also fixed a defect nobody was looking for: keep-alive was broken for every
GET.** One upstream line meant every request paid a TCP handshake, with no
`Connection: close` advertised, so no client could know. The corpus proved that
a *bad* request retires a connection; nothing proved that a *good* one preserves
it.

**Phase 5 shipped the ordinary first-week surface:** CORS, secure static files,
buffered multipart forms and an absolute graceful-drain deadline. It also fixed
an upstream pending-read use-after-free found by the drain laboratory. The
freeze is [`planning/phase-5-freeze.md`](planning/phase-5-freeze.md).

**Phase 6 is in progress.** It makes conventional synchronous application I/O
safe through bounded Handler concurrency, then builds the SQL-first PostgreSQL
and migration ecosystem outside `web`. The accepted contract is
[`planning/phase-6-spec.md`](planning/phase-6-spec.md).

**Before deploying, read [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md)** — in
particular what the framework does and does not bound.

**What works today**

- A real HTTP server: `web.serve(&app, port)` binds a port and answers.
- Routing with static and `:param` segments; static routes win over
  parametric ones.
- Middleware with `web.use` — onion model, so code after `web.next` sees the
  response. Route groups under a prefix with `Router` and `mount`, and
  route-level middleware on the five verbs.
- Request header lookup (`web.header`, `web.bearer_token`) returning views,
  and correlation IDs (`web.request_id`) with a tested trust policy.
- One log line per request (`web.logger`) and a typed framework-error
  observer (`web.observe`) — each costs zero bytes in an application that
  does not use it, proven by `nm` in the gate.
- Path and query extractors that respond with a standardized `400` on bad
  input, so handlers only check a bool and return.
- JSON request bodies (`web.body`) with a fixed 4 MiB cap, decoded into a
  value you own.
- JSON, text and no-content responses, and the five error responders.
- Standardized error envelopes, including the automatic `404` and the `405`
  with an exact `Allow` header.
- Middleware: `web.use` and `web.next`, an onion that unwinds in exact reverse
  order and allocates nothing through the chain. Registration order is
  *enforced*, not documented — `use` after a route rejects the whole
  application and `serve` refuses to bind.
- Detached route collections: `web.router`, `web.mount`, and per-router
  middleware scope.
- Request header lookup (`web.header`) and a strict RFC 6750
  `web.bearer_token`.
- Framework-failure observability: `web.observe` with a typed
  `Framework_Event`, emitted exactly once per failure, identically on both
  transports.
- Two opt-in middlewares: `web.logger` and `web.request_id`.
- In-memory testing with `web.test_request` — real routing, no socket.
- HTTP/1 conformance: ambiguous or malformed framing is rejected and the
  connection closed, proven by a raw-wire corpus (see
  `docs/transport-conformance.md`).
- CORS middleware, secure static-file mounts with ETag/304, and bounded
  buffered multipart fields/files.
- Graceful shutdown with an absolute drain deadline.
- Bounded synchronous Handler concurrency: automatic 4..32 capacity by
  default, explicit `1` for compatibility, and no async Handler API.

**Public surface:** 62 application symbols + 2 test-support symbols = 64 —
frozen. The gate compares the compiler's own exported inventory, down to every
struct field, enum member and enum backing type, against
`build/phase1-public-signatures.txt`, and the direct import set against
`build/phase1-direct-dependencies.txt`. Changing any of it now requires a spec
amendment, not a snapshot refresh.

**Phase 2 froze more than the API.** It added three ledgers the symbol count
cannot express, and the gate enforces all three: a **claim ledger**, where every
guarantee the documentation makes carries a positive test, a negative control
and a stated non-guarantee; a **lifetime ledger**, which answers who owns each
value and until when; and a **capacity ledger**, which forbids the word
"bounded" anywhere a perimeter is not named — including for the limits this
framework does *not* impose.

Internals stay replaceable: the linear route table, the request arena and the
vendored backend are implementation, and may be rewritten as long as the
observable contracts hold.

**Not yet, and named honestly**

- PostgreSQL, explicit transactions and safe migrations — Phase 6 Crystals.
- Response streaming and an opt-in large-body/spool path — separately gated
  Phase 7 work, not implied by buffered multipart.
- WebSocket, HTTP/2 and in-process TLS — outside the current core decision.

**Never, and named just as honestly**

- Panic recovery. Odin has no recoverable panic, so a faulting handler aborts
  the process and Uruquim expects to run under a supervisor (ADR-020). The
  guarantee it *does* make is narrower and real: a handler that commits no
  response is finalized to a standardized 500, identically in tests and over a
  socket. `docs/errors.md` documents both halves.
- A closure-based `web.group`, now or in any future phase. Refused rather than
  deferred (ADR-024): a closure cannot be returned from a procedure in Odin,
  and `web.Router` plus `web.mount` do the job with visible ownership.

What exists today is a production-minded HTTP microframework for JSON APIs,
with explicit operational boundaries and a bootstrap transport intended to be
replaced by the official Odin HTTP package after that real implementation is
available and passes the same conformance corpus. A frozen contract is not a
tag: semantic versioning and any release remain the owner's decision.

## Supported platform and toolchain

Stated honestly rather than implied:

- **Tested: Linux x86-64 only.** macOS, Windows and other architectures are
  **untested** today — they may work, and nobody has proven it.
- **The toolchain pin is part of the contract.** Odin ships monthly `dev-`
  releases with breaking changes and no package manager, so Uruquim pins one
  release, one commit and one asset checksum in
  [`odin-version.txt`](odin-version.txt), and the gate refuses any other
  compiler. Re-pinning is a deliberate, recorded change — not an upgrade that
  happens to you.
- **Consumption is by vendoring or a git submodule** at a pinned commit — the
  ecosystem's own convention, since Odin will never officially support a
  package manager.

The mandatory gate (`build/check.sh`) runs on the pinned toolchain and is the
single source of truth for what "passing" means in this repository.

## Where to start

- **`docs/quick-start.md`** — from nothing to a running API.
- **`examples/01-hello-world`** — the smallest complete program.
- **`examples/02-json-api`** — a CRUD-shaped JSON API.
- **`examples/03-route-params`** — path params and query extractors.
- **`examples/04-middleware`** — the onion model, short-circuits and `next`.
- **`examples/05-route-groups`** — `Router`, `mount` and shared prefixes.
- **`examples/06-authentication`** — the canonical auth pattern, with its
  revalidation cost stated instead of hidden.
- **`examples/07-app-state`** — one typed value every handler can reach, with
  the lifetime rule shown as layout rather than described.

All seven examples compile in the mandatory gate.

**Deploying it?** [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md) is the one to read:
the supported topology, what is bounded and what is not, what to monitor, and a
known-limitations section that does not flatter the framework.

## Licence, security and contributing

Uruquim is [MIT licensed](LICENSE).

It parses HTTP from untrusted clients, so it has a real attack surface. If you
find a security problem, please report it privately — [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)
explains how, and lists what is a documented limitation rather than a
vulnerability.

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains the two things that surprise
people: the public API is frozen and the build enforces it, and growing it
requires measured evidence rather than agreement.

Notable changes are recorded in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). There has been
no release: no tag exists, and cutting one is the owner's decision. What happens
next is planned in [`planning/roadmap.md`](planning/roadmap.md).

**Consuming Uruquim.** Odin has no package manager
[by design](https://odin-lang.org/docs/faq/), so vendor the `web/` directory or
add this repository as a submodule, and build with `-collection:uruquim=<path>`.
The Odin toolchain version is part of the contract — the pinned release, commit
and asset checksum are in `odin-version.txt`.

GitHub Actions is not required: a tracked pre-push hook runs the mandatory
gate, and the project VPS repeats it from a clean commit on an enabled systemd
timer. Current work-package status lives in `planning/phase-1-plan.md`.
