// WP3 — PUBLIC TEST-SUPPORT FACADE (package `web`).
//
// This file adds the ONLY two public test-support symbols: `Recorded_Response`
// and `test_request`. They are a SEPARATE ledger (planning/public-api-guardrails.md G-11): public,
// documented, and behavior-tested exactly like the application surface, but
// tracked apart from the frozen 32-symbol application count. Total exported
// after WP3: 34 = 32 application + 2 test-support.
//
// The facade is thin. It converts `App`/`Method` and the captured internal
// `Response` across the boundary to the neutral machinery in `web/testing`,
// which owns the request/response representation and the response copies. The
// machinery never names a `web` type, so `web -> web/testing` stays one-way (the
// back-edge is a compile cycle, ratified as probe C5).

import transport "uruquim:web/internal/transport"
import testing "uruquim:web/testing"

// Recorded_Response is the read-only result of `web.test_request`.
//
// It exposes exactly two fields in Phase 1:
//
//   - `status`: the response status, COPIED BY VALUE;
//   - `body`:   a string VIEW over a copy owned by the App's test-support state,
//               valid until `web.destroy(&app)`.
//
// There is deliberately NO public `headers`, `committed`, allocator or transport
// field. The recorder copies response headers internally for the future WP4
// tests (405 + `Allow`), but Phase 1 ratifies no public abstraction for reading
// response headers, and adding a field here would freeze one prematurely.
//
// LIFETIME: `body` remains readable, alongside every other response returned by
// the same App, until `web.destroy(&app)` frees the App's test-support state.
// There is no per-response cleanup. Do not retain a `Recorded_Response.body`
// past `destroy`.
Recorded_Response :: struct {
	status: Status,
	body:   string,

	// WP49 — the response headers, as `"Name: value"` lines.
	//
	// **D-14.3 IS DECIDED HERE, AND THIS WORK PACKAGE IS WHY.** Phase 2
	// deliberately kept this type at two fields and recorded the pressure as an
	// open question: an assertion about a response header had to be written as
	// an INTERNAL `package web` test, because the public test transport could
	// not see one. That was tolerable while the only header in question was one
	// the framework set for itself.
	//
	// It stops being tolerable here. `secure_headers` exists so an application
	// can assert its own security posture — and an application that cannot
	// observe the headers it asked for has to test through a socket, which is
	// exactly what `test_request` exists to avoid. **A test-support API that
	// cannot see what the framework sets is a test-support API that pushes
	// people back to the thing it replaced.**
	//
	// LINES RATHER THAN PAIRS, and that is a deliberate refusal of surface: a
	// `Header_Pair` here would export the pair type, and a map would export a
	// lookup contract and an allocation. `"Name: value"` is the wire form, it
	// needs no new type, and `strings.contains` is the whole API. The slice and
	// its strings are owned by the recorder and are valid until the next
	// `test_request` on the same App — the same lifetime `body` already has.
	headers: []string,
}

// test_request drives one in-memory request through dispatch and returns the
// recorded response, WITHOUT binding a socket or port.
//
// WP4 wired routing, so this now returns REAL routed results: a registered
// route's handler runs, an unknown path on `web.app()` produces a 404, and a
// path registered under another method produces a 405. Only `web.destroy` and
// the recorder stand between the caller and the framework's own dispatch.
//
// The framework never fabricates a 200 on a handler's behalf. A handler that
// responds with nothing is finalized by the DRIVER to a logged
// `internal_error`/500 (WP8 D5), exactly as it is over a real socket — HTTP has
// no zero status.
//
// The App's test-support state is created LAZILY here, on the first call, using
// `context.allocator`. An application that never calls `test_request` allocates
// no recorder, runs no initializer, and does not even LINK the recorder
// teardown — this procedure registers it, so eliminating this procedure
// eliminates it too (planning/public-api-guardrails.md G-11). Every copy the
// recorder makes is released by `web.destroy(&app)`.
// The `body` parameter is OPTIONAL and defaults to empty, so every Phase-1 call
// site keeps working unchanged (WP14, ADR-021 as amended).
//
// It is a default parameter rather than a procedure group on purpose. `odin doc`
// renders a group as `name :: proc{member_a, member_b}` — member names only — so
// a group over `@(private)` members would pin this symbol's NAME in the freeze
// snapshot while leaving its parameters free to change. That was measured, and
// `build/check_phase1_freeze.sh` now rejects the construct. A default parameter
// keeps the whole signature inside the frozen record, and it is how `core` adds
// optional behavior everywhere (`allocator := context.allocator`).
//
// The body travels the SAME driver path a socket uses: it is placed on the
// neutral `Inbound` and nothing downstream can tell the two transports apart.
// That is what makes the 4 MiB cap and the JSON errors identical here and on a
// real connection (R-10), rather than a claim this facade makes about itself.
// WP19: `headers` is the THIRD fully visible default parameter, on exactly the
// ADR-021 terms the first two set — the whole callable contract stays inside
// the frozen record, and every earlier call shape compiles unchanged. Each
// element is one header line, `"Name: value"`: split at the FIRST colon, with
// optional whitespace (SP/HTAB) trimmed around the value — the same field
// parsing a socket transport performs, so the in-memory request carries
// exactly what the wire would deliver. Inner colons stay in the value; an
// element with no colon is a name with an empty value (an empty value is a
// PRESENT header). No test-only header type exists and `Header_Pair` stays
// private: strings were chosen over a pair type precisely so the test-support
// ledger stays at 2 (spec §9.3's stated contingency was not needed).

	//    that does the response's own allocation become releasable — tearing
	//    down first would hand the recorder a freed buffer to copy. A borrowed
	//    body (a static envelope, or the fixed WP5 buffer) is left alone.
