// WP29 — the route index. A segment-keyed radix tree, chosen from measurement.
//
// WP28 measured seven representations across four shapes and four
// cardinalities (`planning/router-shootout.md`). This is `radix_idx`: nodes in
// a flat array, children by index, static child tried before the parametric one
// at every level. At 5,000 mixed routes it matched in ~1.4 us against the flat
// scan's ~191 us, and — the property that actually mattered — it is FLAT from
// 5 routes to 5,000 while every linear variant grows with the table.
//
// WHY INDICES AND NOT POINTERS. The timing did not choose: `radix_ptr` and
// `radix_idx` are the same algorithm in two layouts and their medians differed
// by less than either measurement's own spread. The choice was made on
// ownership. A `^Node` held across an `append` to the node array dangles the
// moment the array reallocates — the same class of defect as P8, which the
// middleware pool's `chain_start`/`chain_len` index pairs already exist to make
// impossible (spec §2.2). This file inherits that discipline: `index_node`
// returns an int, and every parent is re-indexed AFTER its child exists.
//
// WHY A MAP INSIDE A NODE. Measured too, and against the alternative the idiom
// guide's warning would have favoured. A sorted array with binary search lost
// in eight cells out of eight, by 19% to 84% — including on the deep, narrow
// shape where fan-out is ten and binary search should have won. The guide's
// rule about maps in hot dispatch is not overturned, it is SCOPED: it is right
// about PER-REQUEST maps, which allocate. This map is built at registration and
// only read afterwards, and lookup allocates nothing.
//
// THE PERIMETER OF THE CLAIM, because the capacity ledger requires one: WP28
// measured MATCHERS IN ISOLATION. Against the WP26 end-to-end baseline, route
// matching is roughly 10% of dispatch p95 at 5,000 routes. This file makes that
// 10% nearly free. It does not make a request ten times faster, and no document
// may say that it does.
//
// THE FLAT ARRAY REMAINS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH. `a.private.routes` still owns
// every pattern, every handler and every chain index pair, and `mount` still
// copies into it. This tree is an INDEX over that array — it stores integers
// into it and nothing else — so registration, teardown and mounting keep the
// ownership they were specified with, and a bug here can lose a lookup but can
// never lose a pattern.

// ROUTE_NODE_NONE marks an absent child or an unregistered method.
