# WP24 — the documentation controls, as one executable run.
#
# WP24 SHIPS NO SYMBOL, so its controls cannot be "mutate the code and watch a
# test go red". What it ships is TEACHING, and teaching fails in two ways: it
# can teach something the framework forbids, and it can quietly stop saying
# something that still matters. Both are probed here.
#
#   1  a `user_data` bag in an example      -> the guardrail scan MUST reject it
#   2  `use` AFTER the protected route      -> the example MUST fail loudly
#   3  the ownership table deleted          -> the docs gate MUST reject it
#   4  an ownership COLUMN dropped          -> the docs gate MUST reject it
#   5  the single-server rule (R-10) deleted-> the docs gate MUST reject it
#   6  POSITIVE: all seven examples still build and the docs gate is green
#
# CONTROL 2 IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST. WP12 D-12.5 measured a mis-ordered
# auth program answering `200 OK` with the secret body to an unauthenticated
# caller. Example 06 teaches the correct order; this control re-creates the
# WRONG order and requires the framework to reject the program — so the example
# is teaching a rule the framework actually enforces, not a convention.
#
# CONTROL 6 IS THE POSITIVE HALF. Controls 3-5 are all satisfied by deleting
# the documentation entirely, and control 1 by having no examples at all.
