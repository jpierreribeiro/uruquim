# WP22 — the seven required `logger` mutation controls, as one executable run.
#
# The WP17-WP21 protocol, unchanged: each control re-creates a specific defect
# in a THROWAWAY copy of the shipped sources and requires the WP22 test suite
# to catch it. Every probe (a) runs its selected tests UNMUTATED first and
# requires them green with at least one test executed, (b) asserts its own edit
# applied by md5 — BROKEN PROBE otherwise, never a false verdict — and (c)
# requires the selected tests red afterwards.
#
#   1  the raw PATH used as route identity  -> the pattern-only tests MUST go red
#   2  the line written BEFORE `next`       -> committed-status test MUST go red
#   3  the commit guard ignored             -> uncommitted-status test MUST go red
#   4  the truncation mark dropped          -> truncation-announced test MUST go red
#   5  the escaper bypassed                 -> CR/LF injection test MUST go red
#   6  EVERY line marked truncated          -> the POSITIVE test MUST go red
#   7  binary cost, measured with `nm`      -> zero logger symbols when unused
#
# CONTROL 6 IS THE POSITIVE HALF and it is not decoration. Controls 4 and 5
# are satisfied by an implementation that mangles every line — one that always
# truncates passes "a long pattern is marked" while telling the truth about
# nothing. Control 6 fails that implementation, which is what makes the other
# two mean something.
#
# CONTROL 7 CARRIES ITS OWN POSITIVE CONTROL, on the G-11 gate's pattern: an
# application that DOES use `web.logger` must link the symbols an application
# that ignores it must not. Without that, a typo in the symbol pattern would
# make the zero-assertion pass against every possible binary.
#
# Controls 1-6 need the pinned compiler; control 7 needs the compiler and `nm`.
# Without a toolchain this script reports BLOCKED and exits 2 — it never
# reports a control it did not run.

#
# WHAT THIS CONTROL DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT: byte-identity of the binary.
# `planning/phase-2-plan.md` WP22 asked for "byte-identical to WP17's
# baseline"; that is not a testable property on the pinned toolchain. Five
# builds of an IDENTICAL source tree produced five different binaries
# (876,304 / 876,352 / 876,352 / 876,368 / 876,360 bytes, five distinct md5s):
# the vendored `nbio` emits polymorphic instantiations whose mangled parameter
# names vary between runs. Byte-identity therefore fails for a tree compared
# against ITSELF, so asserting it would be a gate that flakes rather than a
# guarantee that holds. The symbol COUNT is stable — 0 across all five rebuilds
# — and is what this control asserts. See plan amendment (2026-07-20).

# meaningless. Both halves are required — the public entry point is emitted as
# `web::logger` and the helpers as `web::[logger.odin]::*`, so a pattern
# carrying only the file-qualified form would miss a regression that linked the
# public procedure while dead-stripping its helpers.
