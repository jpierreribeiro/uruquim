# WP30 — the registration-conflict mutation controls, as one executable run.
#
# The WP17/WP18 protocol, unchanged: each control re-creates a specific defect
# in a THROWAWAY copy of the shipped sources and requires the WP30 suite to
# catch it. Every probe (a) runs its selected tests UNMUTATED first and requires
# them green with at least one test executed, (b) asserts its own edit applied
# by md5 — BROKEN PROBE otherwise, never a false verdict — and (c) requires the
# selected tests red after the mutation.
#
# WHY THREE AND NOT ONE. A diagnostic has two ways to be wrong and both cost an
# application its boot, so both are controlled:
#
#   1  the detection deleted (silent first-registration-wins, i.e. Phase 1)
#      -> the poison tests MUST go red
#   2  the detection inverted (every route reads as a conflict)
#      -> the "this is NOT a conflict" tests MUST go red
#   3  mount does not stop at the first diagnosis
#      -> the one-line test MUST go red
#
# Control 2 is the one worth having. A rejection rule is only as good as the
# larger set it leaves alone, and a suite that only proves conflicts are caught
# would stay green against an implementation that rejects everything.
#
# All three need the pinned compiler; without one this script reports BLOCKED
# and exits 2. On-demand, like the WP16-WP25 controls — not a per-gate step.
