# WP16 — the six required gate-restructuring controls, as one executable run.
#
# Each control below is ALSO enforced permanently: controls 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6
# live in build/check_wp3_mutations.sh (cases 57, 1, 58/58b, 61 and 59), which
# runs on every gate invocation, and control 5's guard is the freeze gate's
# own proc_group self-test plus its section 3b. This script exists so the six
# WP16 acceptance controls can be produced as one report, on demand, with
# every probe asserting its own edit applied — a probe that fails to mutate
# reports BROKEN PROBE, never a false verdict.
#
#   1  stray web/oops.odin                 -> MUST FAIL   (static)
#   2  extra export                        -> MUST FAIL   (static)
#   3  private parameter rename            -> MUST PASS   (static)
#   4  deleted ledger entry                -> MUST FAIL   (static)
#   5  private-member procedure group      -> MUST FAIL   (needs the pinned toolchain)
#   6  vendor patch re-applied differently -> MUST PASS   (static)
#
# Control 5 is the only one that needs the compiler (`odin doc` generates the
# inventory the freeze gate reads). Without a toolchain this script reports it
# BLOCKED and exits 2 — it never reports a control it did not run.
