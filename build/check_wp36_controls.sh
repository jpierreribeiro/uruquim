# WP36 — the configurable-limits mutation controls.
#
# The WP17/WP18 protocol, unchanged: each control re-creates a specific defect
# in a THROWAWAY copy of the shipped sources and requires the WP36 suite to
# catch it. Every probe (a) runs its selected tests UNMUTATED first and requires
# them green with at least one test executed, (b) asserts its own edit applied
# by md5, and (c) requires the selected tests red after the mutation.
#
#   1  the body comparison pinned back to the fixed constant
#      -> the configurable-cap tests MUST go red
#   2  the driver line that copies the budget onto the Context deleted
#      -> the same tests MUST go red, which is what makes the R-10 claim mean
#         something rather than being two implementations that happen to agree
#   3  the after-dispatch guard deleted
#      -> the rejection test MUST go red
#   4a a constructor left with a zero Limits
#      -> the application MUST STILL SERVE, on the defaults [positive control]
#   4b the same, with the zero-budget safety net also removed
#      -> the no-configuration test MUST go red
#
# Control 2 is the one that makes the R-10 claim mean something: delete the one
# driver line that carries the budget onto the request and `test_request` stops
# agreeing with the socket. Control 4 is the pair that decides what a
# framework-internal slip should COST — see the note above it.
#
# All five need the pinned compiler; without one this script reports BLOCKED and
# exits 2. On-demand, like the WP16-WP37 controls — not a per-gate step.

#
# A CONTROL PAIR, because the interesting answer here is not "red".
#
# 4a is a POSITIVE control. With `bare()` reverted to `App{}` — three zero
# limits — the application must STILL SERVE, because `web.body` resolves a zero
# budget to the default. That asymmetry with the public API is deliberate:
# `web.limits` refuses a partially-filled `Limits`, so an application can never
# choose a zero, and the only way one arrives is a framework-internal omission.
# Reading that as "reject every body" would turn a slip in this repository into
# an application that refuses all traffic — which is not failing closed, it is
# broken. If 4a ever goes red, that safety net has been removed.
#
# 4b is the negative half: with the net ALSO gone, the same forgetful
# constructor produces exactly the silent catastrophe — 413 to every body, while
# every test written against `app()` stays green. That is the failure
# `check_public_api.sh` §8c counts constructors to catch at the gate.
