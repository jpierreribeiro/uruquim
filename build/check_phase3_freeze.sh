# Phase-3 freeze gate.
#
# It checks `planning/phase-3-freeze.md` the way `check_phase2_freeze.sh` checks
# its own document: not that the file exists, but that it still SAYS the things
# a freeze is only worth having if it says.
#
# WHAT IT LEARNED FROM ITS PREDECESSOR, and this is the reason it is written
# this way rather than copied. The Phase-2 gate compared that document's ledger
# diff against the LIVE symbol count. That was indistinguishable from correct
# for as long as no phase grew the ledger afterwards — and went red the moment
# WP34 did, because 44 is what Phase 2 FROZE: a historical fact, not a live
# measurement. A freeze document that must be edited whenever a later phase
# ships is not a freeze.
#
# So this gate pins Phase 3's totals as history from the day they are written,
# checks the document's own arithmetic, and separately requires the LIVE ledger
# not to have SHRUNK below them — which catches the thing the live comparison
# was actually protecting against: a frozen symbol quietly removed while a
# document still claims it. Phase 4 may add freely.
#
# The rest is the Phase-2 shape: a freeze that no longer records its ledger
# amendments, its mutation re-run, its cost measurements or its usage-lab number
# has become a title page.
