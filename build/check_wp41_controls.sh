# WP41 — the fault-laboratory controls.
#
# A lab that reports a finding must first prove the finding is about the SERVER
# and not about the lab. These controls exist because "the connection was held
# open" has three uninteresting explanations before it has an interesting one:
# the client never sent anything, the client never read, or the client's own
# timeout fired for an unrelated reason.
#
#   1  the server's answer is real — the lab reads a 200 from a complete request
#      [POSITIVE control, and it runs FIRST because every other result is
#      meaningless without it]
#   2  the lab's determinism is real — the same seed replays, a different seed
#      diverges
#   3  the finding is about the SERVER — pointing the same truncated request at
#      a socket with NO server behind it produces a DIFFERENT outcome
#   4  the lab cannot be satisfied by a silent server — a mutation that makes
#      `read_status` treat every timeout as a response turns the findings green,
#      which must be caught
#
# Control 3 is the one that makes the slowloris finding admissible. Without it,
# "held open until the lab gave up" is a sentence about the lab.

# even connect, which is a different Outcome member.
#
# This is asserted by MUTATION rather than by a second suite: point the phase at
# a port nothing is listening on, and the expectation must go RED. A green run
# would mean the lab produces its headline finding without a server at all.

# THE MUTATION REMOVES THE CAPABILITY, NOT ONE ROUTE TO IT — and two earlier

# `read_status` reports "held open" from TWO places: the timeout branch inside
# the loop, and the tail after the loop exits. Deleting either one alone leaves
# the other producing the same observation, so the suite stayed green and the
# control accused the gate of a hole that was really a probe pointed at one of
# two doors.

# The rule this earned, and it generalises past this file: a probe must remove
# the ability to make an observation, not one path that happens to reach it.
# Same class as WP39's control 6 and WP18's control 6 — three in one session.
# THE COUNT IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED, and WP56's re-run is why this comment
# exists. It was 2; WP45 added `read_status_again` for the keep-alive phases and
# made it 3. The probe caught that IMMEDIATELY rather than silently mutating two
# of three and reporting a hole — which is exactly what the earlier versions of
# this control did, and the reason the assert was added.
#
# It is deliberately an exact count rather than a minimum: a NEW report site is
# a new way to make this observation, and a probe that removes the ability must
# know about all of them. Raising this number is a decision, not an edit.
