# C-01 — the async-operation inventory, under control.
#
# The inventory only works if it CANNOT go stale. Five executable claims:
#
#   1. the CENSUS holds — the number of `nbio.*_poly*(` operation-creating call
#      sites in the tree equals the number `planning/closure-async-op-inventory.md`
#      declares on its `c01-op-sites` marker. An operation added without a row
#      fails the build. The number lives in the LEDGER, never here: a gate
#      rewritten by the change it judges tests nothing;
#   2. the ten questions are still the ten questions — an inventory that quietly
#      drops "can the callback touch freed memory?" is an inventory that would
#      have missed the WP58 use-after-free;
#   3. the F-C01-1 guard is present at BOTH accept re-arm sites. The behavioural
#      trigger is fd exhaustion (`EMFILE`), which a test suite cannot induce
#      without endangering the runner, so this claim is structural ON PURPOSE
#      and says so;
#   4. the F-C01-6 trigger has not been pulled — `respond_file` stays unreachable
#      from `web/`, because wiring it in would inherit three uncancellable
#      operations whose callbacks dereference a freed `^Connection`;
#   5. the four interruption phases exist by name and the suite is green.

# guard is written, and the reasoning for why it must be is in the inventory.

fewer than two accept re-arm guards in vendor/odin-http/server.odin.
Both delayed re-arms — the .Insufficient_Resources one-second retry and the
Patch-21 transient ten-millisecond retry — must re-arm only when the lane has no
accept and is not inside a Handler. Without the guard the re-arm overwrites
td.accept, the earlier accept becomes unreachable, and it survives
nbio.remove(td.accept) at shutdown: num_waiting() never reaches zero and the
drain never ends. See F-C01-1.

three operation handles and its callbacks dereference ^Response, which lives
inside ^Connection — and connection_close/connection_abort cancel only

use-after-free on a third path. Give those operations stored, cancellable
handles and add rows 15-17 to the inventory first. See F-C01-6.
