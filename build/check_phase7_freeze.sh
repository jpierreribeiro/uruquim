# WP101 — Phase-7 freeze gate.
#
# Same shape and lesson as its predecessors: a frozen total is HISTORY. This
# pins Phase 7's ledger diff as written, checks the document's arithmetic,
# requires the live ledger not to have shrunk, and holds the things this freeze
# would lose first if someone tidied it:
#
#   * the record of what was NOT delivered — the public large-body upload API
#     and the 3,000 real-socket round — because a freeze that drops those rows
#     reads as a phase that delivered everything;
#   * the five public symbols by name, so a ledger row cannot become a number
#     nobody can check;
#   * the graceful-close and safe-without-tuning decisions, which are the ones a
#     later refactor would quietly reverse;
#   * G7-8 (pay only when used) and the lazy-allocation fix behind it.
