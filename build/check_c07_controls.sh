# C-07 — the Closure record and verdict, under control.
#
# A verdict is worth exactly as much as the evidence still standing behind it.
# Four executable claims:
#
#   1. EVERY INSTRUMENT THE VERDICT CITES STILL EXISTS and is still gated. A
#      verdict that outlives its evidence is a claim, not a record;
#   2. THE EXIT CONDITION IS QUOTED VERBATIM, so the phase cannot be judged
#      against a softened version of its own bar;
#   3. THE RESIDUAL IS STILL NAMED. F-C03-2 is an OPEN defect; a record that
#      quietly drops it turns a qualified verdict into a false one;
#   4. THE DEFERRALS STILL CARRY TRIGGERS. Deferred work here means a
#      specification handed forward, not an open question.
