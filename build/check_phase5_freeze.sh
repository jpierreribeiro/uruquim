# Phase-5 freeze gate.
#
# Built on the WP38/WP56 shape and its lesson: **a frozen total is HISTORY.**
# This pins Phase 5's totals as of the day they were written, checks the
# document's own arithmetic, and separately requires the live ledger not to have
# SHRUNK — so a later phase may add freely while a removed symbol is still
# caught.
#
# It additionally holds the four things this phase would lose first:
#
#   * the record of what was NOT delivered, and large uploads in particular. A
#     freeze that drops those rows reads as a phase that delivered everything,
#     which is the one lie a freeze document can tell just by being tidy;
#   * the record that guardrail 3 was VIOLATED and then fixed. The measurement
#     is the only reason anyone knows the pointer indirection is load-bearing,
#     and a tidy-up that deleted it would leave the next author free to call the
#     file server directly again;
#   * the drain's two defects, because "the drain deadline shipped" is a much
#     smaller statement than "shutdown could hang or crash, and both are fixed";
#   * ADR-033's closure ON ITS STATED TERMS — keep and patch, with the January
#     transition as the declared exit rather than a hypothetical.
