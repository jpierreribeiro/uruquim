# Phase-4 freeze gate.
#
# Built on the WP38 shape and its lesson: **a frozen total is HISTORY.** This
# pins Phase 4's totals as of the day they were written, checks the document's
# own arithmetic, and separately requires the live ledger not to have SHRUNK —
# so Phase 5 may add freely and a removed symbol is still caught.
#
# It additionally holds the two things this phase would lose first:
#
#   * the record of what was NOT delivered. A freeze that drops those rows
#     reads as a phase that delivered everything, which is the one lie a freeze
#     document can tell just by being tidy;
#   * the record that re-running the mutation suites REPAIRED controls. Three
#     broke because the tree improved, and a freeze that reports "fifteen green"
#     without that has kept the ceremony and lost the point.
