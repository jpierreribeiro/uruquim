# Surface checkpoints: WP1 = 29 symbols; WP2 = 32 (29 + Request + Method +
# Header_View). The count is EXACT in both directions: a
# missing symbol and an extra symbol are equally a failure.
#
# WP3 (planning/public-api-guardrails.md G-11) adds a SECOND, separate ledger.
# The application ledger stays frozen at exactly 32. The test-support facade in
# `web/test_support.odin` — package `web`, exactly `Recorded_Response` and
# `test_request` — is its own 2-symbol ledger. The exported union is exactly 34.
# The machinery lives in `web/testing/` (package `testing`), imports neither
# `uruquim:web` (cycle) nor `core:testing`, and exposes a locked, minimal set of
# bridge declarations the facade calls across the package boundary.

# expected and legitimate in internal architecture documentation; a textual

# The web/ file-set contract — DERIVED, not enumerated (WP16, audit A-6).
#
# Phase 1 pinned an exact filename list here, which made every honest refactor
# (splitting errors.odin, adding a ratified Phase-2 file) a gate edit. The
# contract was never really "these thirteen names": it is that every file in
# the shipped package DECLARES WHICH LEDGER IT BELONGS TO, so the two ledgers
# can be scanned without a hand-maintained list and a stray file cannot slide
# in unclassified. Each top-level web/*.odin therefore carries exactly one
# marker line, directly under its package declaration:
#
#     // uruquim:file application     (application-ledger surface + internals)
#     // uruquim:file test-support    (the G-11 test-support facade)
#
# and each web/testing/*.odin carries:
#
#     // uruquim:file test-machinery
#
# A file with no marker, two markers, or a marker foreign to its directory
# fails this gate: legitimacy travels WITH the file, so splitting a file or
# adding a ratified one needs no build/ edit, while web/oops.odin dropped in
# without declaring itself is still rejected. What keeps this honest is that
# the marker never decides what may be EXPORTED — the two-way ledger diffs
# below still pin every public symbol exactly, in both directions.
#
# NO TEST FILE may appear in the shipped package regardless of marker: see
# section 0. Subdirectory structure stays exact: only web/testing/ (WP3) and
# web/internal/transport/ (WP8) exist.

# previously forbade `headers` BY NAME, which was right for as long as the only
# response header worth asserting was one the framework set for itself: an
# internal `package web` test could see it, and the type stayed at two fields.
#
# `secure_headers` ends that. Its entire purpose is letting an APPLICATION
# assert its own security posture, and an application that cannot observe the
# headers it asked for has to test through a socket — which is exactly what
# `test_request` exists to avoid. **A test-support API that cannot see what the
# framework sets pushes people back to the thing it replaced.**
#
# The field is `[]string` in wire form rather than a pair type or a map: a pair
# type would export `Header_Pair`, and a map would export a lookup contract and
# an allocation. Strings are the vocabulary the bridge already shares.
#
# The list stays EXACT in both directions. This is a widening by one field with
# a recorded reason, not a relaxation.
# EXTRACTED WITH `sed -n ... p`, not with a bare substitution, and WP49 is why.
# A substitution REPLACES matching lines and passes everything else through
# unchanged — so a struct with doc comments in it yielded the comment text as
# though it were field names. That went unnoticed because this struct had no
# comments until a field arrived that needed explaining.

#
# For a PROCEDURE, the declaration is the SIGNATURE and stops at the opening

# tested the difference, because no exported body had needed an untyped
# pointer. `app_with_state` does: it converts `^$T` to the private `rawptr`
# field the App stores, which is precisely the typeid-validated narrowing the
# ban's own comment above anticipates by name.

# exported signature — `test_request :: proc(` and its four parameter lines —

# package that forgets, and ships an application which rejects all traffic while
# every behavioural test that uses `app()` stays green.
#
# DEFENCE IN DEPTH, and it should be read as that. `web.body` resolves a zero
# budget to the default, so a forgetful constructor produces an application that
# runs on the DEFAULTS rather than one that rejects all traffic — the safe
# outcome, and the right one for a framework-internal slip. This check exists so
# the slip is still caught at the gate instead of being silently absorbed.
#
# The check is a count rather than a list of names, so it needs no maintenance
# when a constructor is added: every literal `App_Internal` value built anywhere
# in the package must carry `limits = DEFAULT_LIMITS`.

# `web.serve` used to write its `Config` into a package variable that the

# fine; with two it is a SILENT CROSS-WIRE — the second `serve` overwrites the
# first's dispatch pointer and requests to one application run the other's.
# Nothing diagnoses it, because from each server's own point of view nothing is
# wrong. That is the worst shape a defect can have.
#
# WP43 moved the config into per-server state reached through the backend
# handler's own `user_data`. This check keeps it there: any package-level
# variable in the adapter that is written per REQUEST rather than per SERVER
# fails here.
#
# `g_server` is deliberately still permitted and is the ONE exception, named
# rather than pattern-matched: `request_stop` asks a process-wide question
# ("stop the running server") that only WP44's public surface can answer
# properly. Naming it means a SECOND such global cannot arrive quietly.

# failure for a file that is simply absent. A gate that diagnoses the wrong
# thing is worse than one that diagnoses late (WP16 control: 'missing WP4
# dispatch file' must be rejected for its own reason).

# label keyed on `/users/42` has one time series per user id, and it puts a user
# identifier into a dashboard nobody meant to put it in.

# The check above keeps the EVENT free of request-derived strings. This one

# returning the path is exactly the drift a single-name guardrail (G-01) exists

#      The old form of this section grepped the vendor sources for the exact
#      spelling of each patch — so a correct re-application written as
#      `if len(token) > 0 {` failed the gate, while an unrelated line that
#      happened to match passed it. Code-shape greps prove spelling, not
#      behaviour. The real evidence is the raw-wire corpus: every one of the
#      five patches exists because a corpus case FAILED before it, and the
#      corpus runs against the real adapter on every gate run
#      (build/check.sh, the wp9-wire step). Reverting a patch therefore fails
#      the gate BEHAVIOURALLY — two of the reversions crash the server
#      process, which is exactly what the corpus observes.
#

#      together with the reversion. So the static assertion that remains is
#      coverage: the corpus must keep carrying a named case for each of the
