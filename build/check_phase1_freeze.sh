# WP11 — PHASE 1 SPEC FREEZE GATE.
#
# This is the gate that makes the Phase-1 freeze mean something. Every other
# checker in build/ proves a behavior; this one proves that the SHAPE of the
# public contract, the dependency set it rests on, and the evidence trail behind
# it are all exactly what planning/phase-1-freeze.md says they are.
#
# It deliberately does NOT re-implement the checks that already exist. The
# public-surface counter, the documentation-parity gate and the example gate are
# invoked by build/check.sh in their own steps; duplicating their logic here
# would create two sources of truth that can drift. What this gate adds is the
# part nothing else covers:
#
#   * the FULL normalized signature of all 34 exported symbols, including every
#     struct field, every enum member and every enum backing type, diffed
#     against a committed snapshot;
#   * the direct-import set of every first-party package, diffed against a
#     committed snapshot;
#   * the evidence matrix in the freeze manifest, with every cited file and
#     every cited test identifier resolved against the working tree;
#   * the absence of unfinished-work markers and future-phase vocabulary.
#
# A snapshot diff is the mutation probe: adding a symbol, changing an argument,
# widening an enum, adding a field, moving a symbol between ledgers or renaming
# anything all surface as a diff and fail the gate.
