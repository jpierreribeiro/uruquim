# C-03 — the closed fault-injection campaign, under control.
#
# The campaign's value is that the SPACE is enumerated, so a future defect is a
# new cell rather than a new category. Five executable claims:
#
#   1. the GRID IS WHOLE — every cell in planning/closure-fault-campaign.md
#      carries a disposition (covered / filled here / declared / external). A
#      cell with no owner is the state nobody drove, which is precisely how
#      .Will_Close survived seven phases;
#   2. the six cells C-03 filled exist by name — a dropped test cannot hide
#      behind a green run;
#   3. the two fixes this WP made cannot be silently reverted: `.Will_Close` is
#      still handled by the drain loop (F-C03-1) and the peer-gone fast close is
#      still guarded by "no send in flight" (patch 25);
#   4. the RST verdict block is still in the campaign record — the measurement
#      is the deliverable, and a fix whose evidence is deleted is a fix nobody
#      can re-derive;
#   5. the suite is green.

That state is entered for every request carrying `Connection: close`, every
HTTP/1.0 request and every failed body read. An omitted case in a #partial
switch is silence: the connection stays in td.conns, len(td.conns) never
reaches zero, and the drain loop never breaks — past EVERY deadline, which makes
max_drain_time bound nothing. Measured: one client sending `Connection: close`
and not reading an 8 MiB response hangs web.stop indefinitely.

the peer-gone fast close is gone or has lost its guard (vendored patch 25).
Both conditions are load-bearing. Without `peer_gone`, a connection whose client
is still draining a response would lose its RFC 7230 6.6 linger. Without
`!had_send_in_flight`, a close that began with a response outstanding would stop
taking the courteous path. And without the fast close at all, every RST'd
connection holds an admission slot for the whole 500 ms Conn_Close_Delay: a
healthy client was served 1 probe in 59 under an RST flood before this patch,
and 56 in 56 after it.
