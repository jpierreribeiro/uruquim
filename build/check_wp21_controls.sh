# WP21 — the fault-behaviour controls, as one executable run.
#
# WP21 ships ZERO public symbols (ADR-020). Its deliverable is a GUARANTEE and
# a STATEMENT, and both are the kind of thing that rots silently: the guarantee
# because it lives in one branch of one procedure that nothing forces anyone to
# keep, the statement because prose never fails to compile. So the controls
# come in three kinds, and all three are needed:
#
#   BEHAVIOURAL (1-4) — re-create a defect in a THROWAWAY copy of the shipped
#     sources and require the WP21 suites to catch it.
#   STATIC (5-6) — re-create a defect the GATE must reject: an exported
#     `recovery`, and a document that promises recovery is coming.
#   EXECUTED (7) — the one claim no in-process test can make, because making it
#     kills the test runner: a faulting handler ABORTS THE PROCESS. It is
#     proven by building programs and running them, and its BASELINE twin must
#     exit cleanly, or the probe would "pass" on a build that was simply broken.
#
# Every probe (a) runs its selection UNMUTATED first and requires it green with
# at least one test executed, (b) asserts its own edit applied by md5 — BROKEN
# PROBE otherwise, never a false verdict — and (c) requires red afterwards.
#
#   1  driver_finalize never called      -> the driver-guarantee tests MUST go red
#   2  a fault answered 200              -> the status tests MUST go red
#   3  the request path composed into it -> the redaction tests MUST go red
#   4  the guarantee latches after one   -> the repeatability test MUST go red
#   5  `recovery` exported               -> check_public_api.sh MUST reject
#   6  a doc promises recovery (Phase 2) -> check_docs.sh MUST reject
#   7  a panicking handler               -> the PROCESS MUST DIE (and the
#                                           identical non-panicking one must not)
#
# Controls 1-4 and 7 need the pinned compiler; 5-6 are static. Without a
# toolchain this script reports BLOCKED and exits 2 — it never reports a
# control it did not run.

# programs and reading their exit status.
#
# THE BASELINE IS THE POINT. An identical program with the fault removed must
# exit 0. Without it, a broken build, a missing collection or a link error
# would also produce a non-zero exit, and this control would "prove" the abort
# while proving nothing at all.
#
# Two fault classes are probed, because ADR-020 turns on their difference:
# `panic` reaches `assertion_failure_proc`, while a bounds-check failure is
# `proc "contextless"` and cannot consult a hook even in principle. BOTH abort.
# That is why no hook-based design could have delivered recovery.
