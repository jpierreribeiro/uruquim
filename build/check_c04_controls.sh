# C-04 — response size and memory retention, under control.
#
# Four executable claims:
#
#   1. the two-phase shape is intact — the suite must serve BIG responses and
#      then MANY SMALL ones on the SAME connections. Collapse it to one phase
#      and it can no longer tell retention (expected, an arena) from a leak (a
#      defect); the number it printed would then mean nothing;
#   2. the baseline is honest — the client's scratch buffer is touched before
#      RSS is first read. Without that, ~4 MiB of the CLIENT's memory is
#      reported as the framework's retention, which is how the first version of
#      this suite got 0.88x instead of 1.01x;
#   3. the decision and its sizing rule survive in the record — a delegation is
#      only acceptable while it is documented, and the number is what makes it
#      documentable;
#   4. the suite is green.

the client scratch buffer is no longer touched before the baseline RSS reading.
RSS counts resident pages, not reservations, so an untouched buffer becomes
resident during phase 1 and is charged to the framework. The first version of
this suite did exactly that and reported 0.88x retention where the honest figure
is 1.01x — the client's own 4 MiB, attributed to the server.
