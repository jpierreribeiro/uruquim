# WP38 — the Phase-3 freeze-gate controls.
#
# A freeze gate that cannot fail is a title page with a green tick on it. The
# WP25 protocol, applied to `check_phase3_freeze.sh`: each control mutates a
# THROWAWAY copy of the tree so that a specific freeze condition is no longer
# met, and requires the gate to REJECT it — for the right reason, matched on the
# message.
#
#   1  the ledger total restated          -> rejected
#   2  the delta no longer adds up        -> rejected
#   3  a frozen symbol dropped from the table -> rejected
#   4  the mutation-re-run FINDING softened   -> rejected
#   5  the failed cost measurement deleted    -> rejected
#   6  the usage-lab instrument removed       -> rejected
#   7  the guarded lab program pushed past 25 -> rejected (the ADR-029 stop)
#   8  POSITIVE: the real tree freezes
#
# Control 7 is the one the delegation itself turns on. ADR-029 made the freeze
# self-approving ONLY while the recorded criteria hold; a budget breach is a
# reserved matter that goes to the owner. If the gate did not actually stop, the
# delegation would have been a way of skipping the owner rather than a way of
# not stalling.
