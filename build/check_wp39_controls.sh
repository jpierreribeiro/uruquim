# WP39/WP40 — the specification-gate controls.
#
# The WP25 protocol, applied to `check_phase4_spec.sh`: each control mutates a
# THROWAWAY copy of the spec so a specific property is no longer stated, and
# requires the gate to REJECT it — for the right reason, matched on the message.
#
#   1  a lifecycle state deleted            -> rejected
#   2  a sixth state added                  -> rejected
#   3  a proof obligation deleted           -> rejected
#   4  "wait forever is not a deadline" softened -> rejected
#   5  the vendored-drain finding deleted   -> rejected
#   6  a capacity row loses its reservation cell -> rejected
#   7  the reservation rule weakened to "at zero" -> rejected
#   8  POSITIVE: the real spec passes
#
# Controls 6 and 7 are the ones worth having. **The reservation is the column
# that will be filled in with "n/a" under time pressure**, and the inequality
# ("at or below", never "at zero") is the difference between a server that can
# shut down under load and one that cannot. Both failures would leave a spec
# that still looks complete.
