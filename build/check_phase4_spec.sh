# Phase-4 specification gate — WP39 (lifecycle) and WP40 (capacity ledger).
#
# WHY A SPEC NEEDS A GATE AT ALL. Phase 2's WP21 taught this: a zero-symbol work
# package still needs one, because its deliverable is a guarantee plus a
# statement, and an unchecked statement decays into folklore. The Phase-3 freeze
# taught the sharper half — a document can be accurate prose about the past and
# still mislead, and no check catches that unless one is written to.
#
# So this gate holds the SHAPE of `planning/phase-4-spec.md`, not its wording.
# It refuses the four ways a spec like this rots:
#
#   1. the state machine gains a state, loses one, or grows a boolean
#   2. a proof obligation quietly disappears before WP44 has to satisfy it
#   3. a capacity row appears without all five columns — especially the
#      reservation, which is the column the whole section exists for
#   4. the deadline stops being absolute, or "wait forever" creeps back in
#
# It runs in the main gate because a spec that only runs on demand is a spec
# nobody re-reads.
