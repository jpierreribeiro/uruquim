	//
	// WHY: without it, concurrent connections are bounded only by the operating
	// system's file-descriptor limit, and reaching that limit is not a graceful
	// degradation — it is an `accept` failing for reasons the server did not
	// choose, at a moment it did not choose, with whatever consequence the rest
	// of the process happens to have.
	//
	// A REFUSAL IS THE POINT. A server that refuses a connection is degraded and
	// honest; one that accepts everything until the kernel stops it is a server
	// whose failure mode is an accident.

	// always has room to work in. Admission is refused at or below
	// `max_connections - reserved_connections`, never at zero.
	//
	// This is WP40's reservation rule, and the rule exists because **the fatal

	// How long a graceful shutdown may take, measured from the moment

	// behaviour and the default here.
	//
	// WHY IT IS ABSOLUTE. Phase 4 withdrew an earlier attempt because bounding
	// the drain LOOP left `nbio.run()` waiting behind it — a deadline that
	// bounds one of three waits is a deadline that does not bound shutdown. This
	// one covers all three: the loop ticks at `SHUTDOWN_INTERVAL` instead of
	// blocking, `.Active` connections are force-closed once it expires, and the
	// final drain runs under `run_until` rather than `run`.
	//
	// WHAT IT DOES NOT BOUND, and operations.md says so in these words: a
	// handler that blocks. A synchronous Handler cannot be preempted; its lane
	// cannot finish teardown until it returns. Other lanes may still enforce
	// their deadline. The supervisor's kill is still the outer bound.

	// Zero disables it, which is the upstream behaviour and the default here, so
	// this field changes nothing for a caller that does not set it.
	//
	// WHY THIS EXISTS: the upstream read has no deadline at all — `scanner.odin`
	// carries a `TODO: some kinda timeout on this` at the recv site — so a client
	// that opens a connection and sends one byte a minute, or sends a valid
	// prefix and stops, holds the connection open indefinitely. Uruquim's WP41
	// fault laboratory demonstrated both against this server before this patch
	// existed. It is slowloris: one socket, no bandwidth, held forever.
	//
	// WHY A SWEEP AND NOT A TIMER PER CONNECTION: a per-connection timer must be
	// cancelled when the request completes, and a timer that outlives what it
	// was guarding is a use-after-free waiting for a slot to be reused. One
	// periodic sweep per thread has no cancellation problem, no per-connection
	// allocation, and no timer-capacity question — at the cost of granularity,
	// which for a defence measured in seconds is not a cost.
	request_read_timeout:    time.Duration,
	// URUQUIM PATCH 19 (WP90 / ADR-039) — the response write deadline.
	//
	// How long ONE response send may take, from the moment the completed
	// response is handed to the event loop until the backend reports it sent.
	// Zero disables it, the upstream behaviour and the default.
	//
	// WHY THIS EXISTS: a client that stops reading (or reads one byte a
	// minute) parks the response in the send path indefinitely; the connection
	// and its buffers are held for as long as the CLIENT chooses. The same
	// slowloris shape as the read side, pointed at the write side.
	//
	// ENFORCED BY THE SAME SWEEP as the read deadline. A connection past this
	// deadline is ABORTED — closed with SO_LINGER zero so the kernel discards
	// the undelivered tail and sends RST. A graceful close would flush kernel
	// buffers to the slow reader first, making the close invisible for however
	// long megabytes take at the client's chosen pace — the deadline would
	// bound nothing observable. (This is why the Phase-6.5 attempt read as
	// "does not fire": its test watched for EOF that the kernel's buffered
	// bytes delayed past the test window.)
	response_write_timeout:  time.Duration,
	// URUQUIM PATCH 20 (WP90 / ADR-039) — the idle keep-alive timeout.
	//
	// How long a connection may sit BETWEEN requests before the server closes
	// it. Zero disables it (upstream behaviour, default). Distinct from the
	// read deadline: `request_started` is stamped when the server begins
	// waiting for a request, while `idle_since` is cleared the moment request
	// bytes actually arrive — so this bounds only the quiet gap, and closing

			// THE DEFECT. This `#partial switch` named six of the seven

			// the state a connection enters the moment the server decides to
			// retire it after the current response — which `response_must_close`

			// a `#partial switch` is silence, not a compile error: such a
			// connection was neither closed nor logged, it simply stayed in
			// `td.conns`. `len(td.conns)` therefore never reached zero and the
			// loop below never broke — FOREVER, past every deadline, because the
			// force-close was reachable only through the `.Active` arm.
			//
			// MEASURED (C-03 cell D8, and it is a one-line reproduction): one

			// WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. `max_drain_time` is documented
			// as the ABSOLUTE bound on shutdown — the comment forty lines above
			// says it covers all three waits, and `docs/operations.md` tells
			// operators to keep it inside their supervisor's `TimeoutStopSec`.

	// THE DEFECT IT FIXES. `docs/reports/2026-07-23-security-f001-f002.md`
	// recorded, as out of scope, that "under a SUSTAINED RST flood the server
	// stops accepting (all threads alive, listen backlog fills, no crash)".
	// C-03 reproduced it and the measurement named the mechanism, which is not
	// the accept path at all: a healthy client's `connect` kept succeeding
	// throughout (`connect_fail=0`), and what it met was the ADMISSION
	// REFUSAL — 1 probe served out of 59.
	//
	// The cause is here. `active_connections` is decremented in
	// `connection_teardown`, at the END of this chain, so a connection whose
	// peer has already sent RST still occupies one of
	// `max_connections - reserved_connections` slots for the whole
	// `Conn_Close_Delay`. At 500 ms a flood only has to open connections faster
	// than `budget / 500 ms` — 120/s against the lab's 60 slots — to make every
	// later client meet the refusal. The measured flood ran at ~39,900/s, which
	// is a 300-fold oversubscription of the budget by connections that are
	// waiting out a politeness delay owed to a peer that has gone.
	//
	// WHY SKIPPING IT IS SAFE, and the two conditions are both necessary:
	//
	//   * `peer_gone` means the last `recv` reported an orderly FIN or a reset.
	//     No further byte can arrive, and nothing this server writes can be
	//     read. RFC 7230 6.6's advice — close the read side, pause, then close
	//     — protects a client still draining a response; there is no such
	//     client here.
	//   * `!had_send_in_flight` keeps the courteous path for the case that
	//     actually needs it. If a response was outstanding when this close
	//     began, the connection ends the way it always did.
	//
	// Note that the delay was never what flushed the response: a plain `close`
	// (no SO_LINGER) returns at once and the kernel keeps sending what is
	// buffered. That is why this is a scheduling fix and not a wire change —
	// and why it is deliberately NOT the `connection_abort` path, which sets
	// SO_LINGER {1,0} to DISCARD the tail. Nothing is discarded here.
