// WP41 — THE DETERMINISTIC TRANSPORT FAULT LABORATORY.
//
// P-T5, deferred here by name from the Phase-3 plan. This package is the
// INSTRUMENT; `tests/wp41-fault/` is the suite that drives it. The split is the
// WP9 arrangement and it exists for the same reason: the fault menu is
// backend-agnostic DATA, so a future transport can be held to the same menu
// without touching the driver.
//
// WHAT A "FAULT" IS HERE. Every fault in this menu is something a CLIENT can do
// to a server over a real socket, plus two the test process can do to itself
// (request a shutdown mid-flight, register a conflicting route). That boundary
// is deliberate: a lab that reaches inside the server to break it is testing a
// mock, and the whole point is to find out how the REAL server behaves.
//
// DETERMINISM IS THE PRODUCT, and it is what separates this from "run some
// weird requests and see". The seed selects the faults, their parameters and
// their order; the run records a TRAIL; and the success criterion — fixed
// before this file was written — is that the same seed replays the same trail.
// Without that, a failure found at 3 a.m. cannot be handed to anyone.
//
// WHAT THIS PACKAGE MAY NOT DO, because it is machinery and the guardrails
// apply to machinery too (the WP3 rule): it imports no `uruquim:web`, declares
// no `any` and no state bag, and owns no global. The suite passes it a `^Lab`.
