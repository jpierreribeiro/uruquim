// WP26 benchmark harness — the workload half.
//
// A workload is a route table of a chosen size and shape, plus the exact list
// of request paths that will be replayed against it. Both halves are generated
// together, deliberately: a benchmark whose paths are written by hand drifts
// away from the table it is supposed to exercise, and the drift is invisible.
//
// TWO PROPERTIES THIS FILE EXISTS TO GUARANTEE:
//
// 1. THE SWEEP HITS THE WHOLE TABLE. `planning/phase-3-plan.md` names the
//    failure directly — a routing benchmark must not "only ever hit the first
//    route". A linear scan flatters itself spectacularly when every request
//    matches at index 0, and the flattery survives into a representation
//    decision. `paths` therefore covers every registered route, and the runner
//    walks it round-robin.
//
// 2. EVERY REQUEST IS VERIFIED, NOT COUNTED. This is RG-1's amendment, and it
//    is a measured failure rather than pedantry: a reference study threw away a
//    whole ApacheBench run because `ab` speaks HTTP/1.0, the strict server
//    rejected every request, and the tool cheerfully reported 100% non-2xx AS
//    THROUGHPUT. A load generator that gets rejected still reports a number,
//    and the number looks like a number. `dispatch_run` asserts the status of
//    every single response and refuses to return a timing if even one differs.

// The status every benchmark handler commits.
//
// `no_content` is the cheapest responder that still commits: no body to encode,
// no allocation to attribute to the handler. What is being measured is the
// dispatch path, so the handler must contribute as close to nothing as the
// public surface allows — while still committing, because a dispatch that
// commits nothing is finalized to a standardized 500 and would measure the
// error path instead.

// that wins on all-static tables can lose badly on mixed ones. Measuring only
// one shape would answer a question nobody asked.
