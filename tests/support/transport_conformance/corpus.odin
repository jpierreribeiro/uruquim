// WP9 — THE RAW-WIRE CORPUS.
//
// Backend-agnostic DATA: exact bytes to send, and what a safe HTTP/1 adapter is
// allowed to do with them. It imports no backend, so a future adapter (or the
// eventual `core:net/http`) can be held to the same corpus without touching it.
//
// It runs ONLY against real adapters. The in-memory transport has no TCP parser
// and cannot prove framing safety, so pointing this corpus at it would produce
// meaningless green.
//
// THE SAFETY SHAPE. For every ambiguous or malformed case the assertion is not
// "some particular status" but the three properties that actually prevent
// request smuggling and connection desynchronization:
//
//	handler_runs      — did application code see a partial/ambiguous request?
//	connection_closes — is the connection retired rather than reused?
//	smuggled_runs     — did trailing bytes become a SECOND request?
//
// A case is safe when a malformed request runs no handler, closes the
// connection, and never lets following bytes execute. The exact status is
// allowed to vary (400, 417, or a bare close), because a protocol error before
// a framework-owned request exists may legitimately be answered by the adapter
// or by closing (WP9 D6).

Wire_Outcome :: enum {
	// A complete, valid exchange: the handler runs and answers.

	// an immediate close is equally acceptable (WP9 D6).
	Rejected,

// Wire_Case is one raw-wire scenario.
//
// `bytes` is sent verbatim. `allowed_status` lists the status codes a compliant
// adapter may answer with; an empty list means "any status, or none at all"
// (a bare close). `expect_second_request` is the smuggling probe: when a case
// appends bytes that LOOK like a follow-up request, this says whether that
// follow-up is permitted to execute.

// The fixture routes the wire suite serves are `GET /ping` (200 "pong") and
