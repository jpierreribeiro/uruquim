// WP9 — THE SHARED SEMANTIC MATRIX.
//
// One matrix, two factories. Every scenario below is executed by BOTH the
// in-memory transport and the real HTTP server, and both must produce the same
// logical result. That is the whole answer to R-10: if the test transport ever
// "lies" — diverges from a real socket — a scenario here fails on exactly one
// factory and names the divergence.
//
// What this matrix does NOT do is byte-level framing. The in-memory transport
// has no TCP parser, so asking it about `Content-Length` or chunking would be
// theatre. Framing safety is proven only against real adapters, by the raw-wire
// corpus in `corpus.odin`.
//
// `transport_contract_test` is the entry point the architecture spec names:
//
