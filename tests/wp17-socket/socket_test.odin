// WP17 socket contract — the fail-closed guard on the REAL transport.
//
// ADR-019 property (a) requires the guard to live on the dispatch path so both
// transports behave identically; the approved diagnostic additionally promises
// that `web.serve` REFUSES TO START on a poisoned application. The in-memory
// half (every request answers 500) is asserted by tests/wp17-internal and
// tests/wp17-public-surface; this suite asserts the socket half: `serve` on a
// mis-ordered application returns without binding, and nothing ever accepts on
// the port.
//
// The suite deliberately never sleeps its way to readiness: `serve` returning
// is observed through an atomic flag with a bounded poll, and the "nothing is
// listening" claim is a direct dial that must fail. If the guard were missing,
// `serve` would bind and block, the flag would never set, and the bounded poll
// fails the test (build/check.sh additionally wraps the suite in an external
// timeout, the WP8/WP9 socket-suite rule).
