// H-2 follow-up (F-C03-2 / patch 30) — a server that CANNOT acquire its
// io_uring event loop FAILS GRACEFULLY instead of terminating the process.
//
// The diagnosis (patch 29) showed the "random" startup crash is
// `nbio.acquire_thread_event_loop()` failing because the io_uring rings pin
// memory against RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, asserted rather than handled. Patch 30 unwinds
// it: `listen` returns a `net.Listen_Error`, a failing lane flags and unwinds
// through the wait group, and `web.serve` reports `Serve_Listen_Failed` and
// returns. This test forces the failure and proves the process SURVIVES.
//
// THE PROOF IS SURVIVAL. If the graceful path regressed to the old assert, this
// test PROCESS would abort and the runner would report a crash. Reaching the
// final assertion at all is the evidence. Where the kernel does not account
// io_uring against RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, the failure simply does not trigger and the
// server starts normally — the test then stops it and passes, exercising no
// regression but crashing on none either. On a host where it triggers (kernel
// 7.0 with an 8 MiB memlock, e.g. the verification VPS) it proves the unwind.
//
// Not in the default gate — it mutates a process-wide rlimit and its trigger is
// kernel/host dependent. Run on demand / on the VPS.
