// WHAT THIS SUITE ASSERTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
//
// It does NOT assert a speed. Not one test here fails because something got
// slower, and that is a design decision rather than an omission. FINDING-A
// measured this toolchain producing five different binaries from an IDENTICAL
// source tree, because the vendored `nbio` emits polymorphic instantiations
// whose mangled parameter names vary between runs. A nondeterministic linker
// means nondeterministic code layout, and layout moves branch prediction and
// cache behaviour. A gate that failed on a timing delta would fail randomly,
// and a gate that fails randomly gets switched off — which would cost more
// than the regression it was meant to catch.
//
// What it asserts instead is that THE INSTRUMENT IS SOUND:
//
//   * the percentile function returns values the machine actually observed;
//   * the tolerance derivation is relative and needs more than one run;
//   * every benchmarked response is verified, and — the load-bearing half —
//     that the verification is ABLE TO FAIL;
//   * the sweep hits the whole route table rather than route 0 forever;
//   * per-dispatch allocation is exactly constant, which is noise-free and is
//     where a representation change would actually show up.
//
// The timings themselves are produced by `build/check_wp26_bench.sh` and
// recorded in `planning/phase-2-baseline.md`, where a distribution can be
// reported honestly and a derived tolerance can sit beside it.

//
// THE PERIMETER, stated because the project's capacity ledger requires it: this
// measures `web.test_request`, which includes the test transport and the
// response recorder. It is NOT the perimeter of Phase-2 claim C-5, which
// measured zero allocations around `driver_run`/`driver_cleanup` and explicitly
// NOT around `test_request`. Nothing here widens C-5, and no number produced
// here may be quoted as if it did.
//
// WHERE THE TRACKER IS INSTALLED, and why it is not a detail. The App captures
// an allocator at registration (`route_register` stores
// `a.private.routes.allocator`) and keeps using it afterwards. A tracker
// installed AFTER the App exists therefore sees none of the App's own work.
// The tracker here is installed BEFORE `workload_init` so that the App's
// allocator IS the tracked one — which is the only arrangement in which the
// dispatch delta means what it claims.
//
// `context.temp_allocator` is deliberately NOT tracked. A probe measured this
// path performing zero temp allocations, so tracking it adds nothing — and
// wrapping the temp allocator underneath the `odin test` runner's own memory
// tracking hangs the runner, which is a thing worth writing down rather than
// rediscovering.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED, and what is refused. No threshold is invented here: a
// "must be under N allocations" test would be a number chosen by taste. What is
// asserted is the three properties that make a recorded number trustworthy —
// registration cost is independent of the measurement, dispatch cost scales
// with dispatches, and identical input produces an identical count. The counts
// themselves are recorded in `planning/phase-2-baseline.md`, where WP27's
// allocation audit will start from them.
