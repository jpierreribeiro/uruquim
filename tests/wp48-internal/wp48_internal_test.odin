// WP48 internal contract — `client_ip` walks X-Forwarded-For FROM THE RIGHT
// (ADR-037).
//
// WHY THIS SUITE IS INTERNAL. `web.test_request` drives an in-memory request
// with NO peer, so `trusted_peer` is always false and the header is always
// ignored — the sharpest test of the DEFAULT, and exactly what the public
// wp48 suite asserts. But the correction ADR-037 makes is about the path the
// public suite cannot reach: what `client_ip` returns WHEN the peer IS a
// trusted proxy. That path needs a peer, and the only way to set one without a
// socket is to drive a `transport.Inbound` (which carries `peer`) straight
// through `driver_run`, the same entry point `serve` uses. So this suite is
// internal by necessity, the WP60/WP32b reason unchanged.
//
// THE ASYMMETRY THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. `X-Forwarded-For` grows left to right;
// each proxy appends the address it saw. The leftmost entry is the one a client
// forges before any proxy touches it. The old implementation returned leftmost
// once a proxy was trusted — handing an attacker a free identity. The new one
// walks from the right, discards trusted hops, and returns the first untrusted
// address. The decisive case is
// `wp48i_a_spoofed_leftmost_is_ignored_behind_a_trusted_proxy`.
//
// The resolved address is read from the RESPONSE BODY of each request, never a
// shared global: the runner is multi-threaded, and a file-scope variable would
// race across the tests below.
