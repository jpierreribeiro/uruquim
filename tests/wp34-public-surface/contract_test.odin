// WP34 public-surface contract — `web.route`, the route identity accessor.
//
// ONE SYMBOL: `route :: proc(ctx: ^Context) -> string`. The ledger moves 44 →
// 45, and the whole contract is about WHICH STRING comes back.
//
// THE PATTERN, NEVER THE PATH. `/users/:id`, not `/users/42`. That is C-2's
// constraint — the OpenTelemetry `http.route` rule — and it is the reason this
// accessor is worth a symbol at all: an application that wanted the path
// already has `ctx.request.path`. What it could not get is the LOW-CARDINALITY
// identity, which is the only one safe to key a metric on.
//
// The rule is also a gate assertion (`build/check_public_api.sh` §8b), because
// a test can only check the routes it thought to write while the assertion
// checks every assignment to the slot. Both exist; neither substitutes for the
// other.
//
// ONE SINK PER TEST, through `context.user_ptr` — the WP17 idiom. The pinned
// runner runs tests on eight threads, so a file-scope capture variable shared
// by two tests is a data race that fails at random rather than a convenience.

// the test unable to fail (the defect WP17's mutation control 6 caught).
