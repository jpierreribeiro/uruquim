// G7-6 wire proof — many CONCURRENT DETACHED STREAMS on REAL sockets.
//
// The registry-level 3,000 is already proven, deliberately, by
// `tests/wp96-scale` (in memory, no sockets). What that suite cannot show is the
// whole path — real client connections, the owner-lane pump, chunked framing on
// the wire, and a bounded drain — at scale. This suite does, up to the public
// cap.
//
// THE PUBLIC CAP IS 1024, AND THAT IS A FINDING. The detached-stream registry
// defaults to `DEFAULT_MAX_STREAMS = 1024` and there is NO public knob to raise
// it (nothing in `web.Limits` or `web.app` sets stream capacity). So a single
// server admits at most ~1024 concurrent streams through the public surface;
// beyond that `web.stream` returns ok=false. A "3,000 real socket" round on ONE
// server therefore needs either a capacity knob that does not exist yet or three
// servers. This suite proves the real-socket path at `SCALE_CONNS` (default 500,
// safely under the cap); the runbook raises it toward the cap on a quiet host.
//
// DESIGN: one broadcaster for N streams. Each handler opens a stream and hands
// its token to a shared slice; a SINGLE background thread sends a few chunks to
// every token and closes them — N streams, one producer, so the thread count is
// N clients plus one, not 2N.
