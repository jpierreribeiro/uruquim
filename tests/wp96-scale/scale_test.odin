// WP96 — the scale claim of G7-6, exercised on the registry directly.
//
// G7-6 requires 3,000 open streams to terminate or be cancelled within the
// drain deadline. The registry is the machinery that must scale; proving it at
// 3,000 slots in memory (no sockets) is both faithful and reliable — the
// real-wire path is proven separately at modest count by tests/wp95-drain and
// tests/wp96-public-stream, which this scale test deliberately does not
// duplicate on 3,000 real connections (that belongs to a dedicated quiet CI
// machine; see the honest limitation recorded in the WP101 freeze).
