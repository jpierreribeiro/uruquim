// WP35 — R-16 measured: does an oversize request permanently raise memory?
//
// RG-4's question is "what happens to a request arena after an unusually large
// body — retain, trim or release?" and R-16's signals are stated precisely:
// retained capacity follows peak body size, and memory does not return near
// baseline after a giant request.
//
// THIS WORK PACKAGE'S OWN DISCIPLINE COMES FIRST, because it decides the
// answer: **while nothing is pooled, do not build the abstraction.** An empty
// generational wrapper around storage that is never reused is complexity with
// no defect to catch. So the first thing to establish is whether anything is
// pooled at all — and the honest way to establish it is to measure, not to read
// the code and conclude.
//
// WHAT THE MEASUREMENT SHOWS, and §5 of `planning/arena-policy.md` records the
// numbers: retained bytes return EXACTLY to baseline after a 3 MiB body. The
// request arena is created lazily per request and destroyed in
// `driver_cleanup`; every other request-local buffer is a fixed array on a
// `Context` that is a fresh stack value per request. Nothing is pooled, so
// R-16's failure mode cannot occur, and the "release oversize allocations at
// request end" fallback the risk register named is ALREADY the shipped
// behaviour rather than a change to make.
//
// This suite is the tripwire for that. If a later work package pools anything,
// these assertions go red — and that is them doing their job, not a test to
// weaken.
