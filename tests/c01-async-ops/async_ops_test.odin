// C-01 — every async operation, interrupted in each of its states.
//
// THE POINT OF THIS SUITE, in one sentence: the two worst lifecycle defects
// this project has shipped (the orphaned `recv` of WP58/WP59 and the missing
// write deadline of WP90) were both a dropped `^nbio.Operation` handle, and
// neither needed a clever insight to find — each needed one boring question
// asked of one operation. `planning/closure-async-op-inventory.md` asks the ten
// questions of all fourteen operation sites; this suite is the behavioural half
// of that answer, for the four states no existing suite interrupts.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. Where a state is already interrupted by a
// green suite, C-01 cites it rather than re-measuring it — a second copy of a
// test is a second thing to keep true, not a second proof:
//
//	recv, idle keep-alive, cancelled at stop     -> wp58-drain (8 conns, 987 ms)
//	recv, request-line held, force-closed        -> wp58-drain (obligation 3)
//	recv, trickling client, read deadline        -> wp41-fault, wp90-deadlines
//	send, stalled write, abort at the deadline   -> wp90-deadlines
//	stream send, drain deadline                  -> wp95-drain
//	stream send, slow consumer                   -> wp92-backpressure
//	accept, re-armed after a synchronous handler -> wp71/wp72
//
// WHAT IS HERE is the residue — the four measurements the inventory needed and
// nobody had taken:
//
//	P1  the FLOOR of a clean stop, and the operation that sets it. `nbio`'s
//	    `num_waiting()` counts timeouts, and the Date cache re-arms a 1 s
//	    timeout it keeps no handle for, so an idle server's drain cannot end
//	    faster than the tail of that timeout. wp58 measured 990 ms and read it
//	    as noise. It is not noise, it is operation #12, and naming it is the
//	    difference between a floor and a mystery.
//
//	P2  a `recv` interrupted MID-REQUEST-LINE — the partial-token state, where
//	    the scanner holds a buffer and an outstanding read.
//
//	P3  a `send` interrupted IN FLIGHT to a client that never reads, with
//	    `max_write_time` set LONGER than `max_drain_time`. This is the exact
//	    experiment that proves finding F-C01-2: the deadline sweep returns
//	    early once `closing` is set, so during a drain the write deadline is
//	    not what ends anything — `max_drain_time` is. If the sweep still ran,
//	    this phase would end at the write deadline instead, and the assertion
//	    below would fail.
//
//	P4  a connection ABORTED by the write deadline (SO_LINGER 0 -> RST) and
//	    then stopped. The abort path cancels both outstanding operations and
//	    calls `close_poly` with no delay; nothing else in the tree checks that
//	    a stop AFTER an abort is still prompt, which is where a double free or
//	    a surviving handle would show.
//
// METHOD. Every phase measures BEHAVIOUR on a real socket and times the stop
// against a semaphore posted after `web.serve` returns — never `thread.join`,
// which cannot time out and would turn a stuck drain into a stuck suite (the
// WP58 harness rule). Package counters are never consulted: the WP2 two-
// instance trap.
