// ONE SYMBOL. It exists because §3.5 of the redaction policy DEMANDS it, not
// because a counter felt useful: any component that can discard work must count
// what it discarded, because **a metric that silently stops being emitted reads
// as "nothing happened"**.
//
// WP47 gave the framework the ability to refuse a connection. Until this symbol
// existed that discard was invisible — a server under admission pressure looked,
// from outside, exactly like a server nobody was talking to.
