// WP58 — THE DRAIN ANATOMY, and obligation 3 put back where it can fail.
//
// Phase 4 withdrew the drain deadline. The record says the mechanism was
// `nbio.run()` waiting on every pending operation, and that bounding the drain
// LOOP was not enough. That account is true and it is incomplete, and the
// difference matters because WP44 patched against the incomplete version.
//
// THERE ARE THREE UNBOUNDED WAITS ON THE SHUTDOWN PATH, not one:
//
//	1. `server.odin:340` — `nbio.tick()` inside the drain loop, with NO timeout.
//	2. `server.odin:349` — `nbio.run()`, which by definition waits for every
//	   pending operation.
//	3. `server.odin:392`/`:464` — `Conn_Close_Delay`, 500 ms PER CONNECTION.
//
// And a fourth fact that is not a wait but makes all three worse:
// `server_deadline_sweep` returns early when `closing` is set
// (`server.odin:773`) and never reschedules. The read deadline — the only
// defence against a client that stops sending — switches itself off at exactly
// the moment the drain needs it most.
//
// A FINDING FROM READING, BEFORE ANY MEASUREMENT: `SHUTDOWN_INTERVAL` is
// defined at `server.odin:284` and is never used. The comment above
// `server_shutdown` says the drain should "repeat every SHUTDOWN_INTERVAL until
// no more connections are open" — the code calls `nbio.tick()` with no timeout
// instead. The loop was designed to poll and does not.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE DOES. It measures which wait dominates, by driving the server
// into one connection state at a time and timing the stop. That is the whole
// method: the states are what a client can produce, so the finding is about the
// shipped server rather than about an instrumented copy of it.
//
//	baseline   no connections            -> the positive control
//	idle       completed keep-alive       -> `.Idle`, which the drain DOES close
//	active     request line sent, held    -> `.Active`, which the drain only LOGS
//
// WHAT THE MEASUREMENT FOUND, and it is worse than the hypothesis it was
// written to test.
//
//	baseline  conns=0            returned=true   elapsed=990ms
//	idle      conns=8 .Idle      returned=FALSE  elapsed=3.0s (deadline)
//
// **Idle keep-alive connections block the drain too.** The plan expected only
// `.Active` to hang, because `.Idle` is one of the three states the drain loop
// closes. It closes them, and the drain still does not end — which relocates the
// mechanism and confirms the Phase-4 account rather than replacing it:
//
//	`connection_close` shuts down the send side, waits `Conn_Close_Delay`, closes
//	the fd, deletes the map entry and frees the `^Connection`. So `td.conns` DOES
//	empty and the loop DOES break. Then `nbio.run()` waits — and every keep-alive
//	connection left a `recv` outstanding, posted by `scanner.odin:205`, which
//	nothing ever cancels. `run()` waits on operations whose connection has already
//	been freed.
//
// THE SECOND FINDING IS A USE-AFTER-FREE, and it is why WP59 is a correctness
// fix and not only a shutdown feature. Releasing the client's sockets lets those
// orphaned `recv` operations complete; `scanner_on_read` then dereferences
// `s.connection` (`scanner.odin:209`) to reach its arena — a connection
// `connection_close` freed at `server.odin:471`. The process dies with
// `free(): invalid pointer`. Measured, reproducibly, by this suite.
//
// So the drain has two ways to end today and both are wrong: wait forever, or
// crash. That is the case for cancelling the operation rather than bounding the
// wait around it, and `scanner.odin:205` discarding the `^nbio.Operation` — with
// upstream's own `// TODO: some kinda timeout on this` one line above it — is
// the reason it cannot be cancelled yet.
//
// The last two phases are obligation 3, and they are expected to FAIL until
// WP59. They are committed RED on purpose: a test that has never failed is a
// test nobody has shown to test anything.
//
// HOW IT FAILS WITHOUT HANGING, which is the part WP44 could not solve. The
// suite never blocks on an unbounded join. It waits on a semaphore the serve
// thread posts AFTER `web.serve` returns, with a deadline. When the deadline
// expires it RESCUES the server by closing the client socket — and the rescue
// is the diagnostic rather than mere cleanup: if releasing the client's socket
// lets the drain finish, then the drain was waiting on that connection's
// pending operation, which is the mechanism WP59 has to cancel.
