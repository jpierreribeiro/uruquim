// WP48 public-surface contract — trusted proxies and the effective client
// address.
//
// TWO SYMBOLS, ledger 51 → 53: `client_ip` and `trust_proxies`. ADR-013's
// fail-closed arm, implemented.
//
// **THE WHOLE SUITE IS ABOUT ONE ASYMMETRY.** `X-Forwarded-For` is a request
// header, so any client can send one. The things applications do with a client
// address — rate-limit buckets, audit logs, allow-lists, abuse counters — are
// exactly the things an attacker must not be allowed to choose. So the header is
// believed only when the CONNECTED PEER is one the operator named, and the tests
// below spend most of their length on the case where it must be IGNORED.
//
// These run over `test_request`, which has no socket and therefore no peer. That
// is not a limitation here — it is the sharpest possible test of the default:
// **with no peer, nothing is trusted, and a forged header must be ignored.**
// The socket side is covered by `tests/wp41-fault`.
