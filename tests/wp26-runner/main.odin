// WP26 baseline runner — the program that produces the numbers.
//
// This is NOT part of the mandatory gate's fast path, and the split is
// deliberate. `tests/wp26-bench` asserts that the instrument is sound and
// finishes in milliseconds, so it can run on every push. This program runs the
// repeated, alternating sweep that a derived tolerance requires, which takes
// long enough that putting it in the pre-push gate would eventually get the
// gate switched off — and a gate nobody runs is worse than one that measures
// less.
//
// It prints one machine-readable line per measurement and a derived tolerance
// at the end. `build/check_wp26_bench.sh` runs it and captures the output into
// `planning/phase-2-baseline.md`.
//
// THE ALTERNATING ORDER, which is a correctness property rather than a style:
// the outer loop is the repetition and the inner loop is the configuration, not
// the other way round. Running all ten repetitions of one configuration
// back-to-back would let that configuration keep a warm cache and a trained
// branch predictor for its whole block, and would then hand the next
// configuration a cold one. The measured difference would be the order.
