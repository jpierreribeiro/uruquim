// WP28 — the shootout's gate half: the candidates agree, or no timing counts.
//
// RG-1's amendment is the reason this file exists before any number is
// reported. **Every candidate must do the same work.** A representation that
// returns the wrong route, or misses a route it should find, will look
// magnificent in a benchmark — a scan that stops early is exactly what "fast"
// looks like from the outside.
//
// The reference study RG-1 cites threw away a whole comparison because the load
// generator spoke HTTP/1.0 and 100% non-2xx was reported as throughput. This
// suite is the same guard, pointed inward: the entrants are checked against
// each other before they are timed against each other.
//
// It asserts NO TIMING. FINDING-E measured a ±57.6% p95 spread on unchanged
// code, so a timing assertion in the gate would fail randomly. The numbers come
// from `tests/wp28-runner`, run by hand, and are recorded in
// `planning/router-shootout.md`.
