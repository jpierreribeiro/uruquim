// WP3 public-surface contract, from OUTSIDE the package (probe C4).
//
// This package is an EXTERNAL consumer of `uruquim:web`. It proves that the two
// symbols WP3 adds — `test_request` and `Recorded_Response` — exist with the
// exact ratified names, are actually exported by package `web` (not
// `web/testing`), and compose as the ratified WP3 contract specifies.
//
// It also RUNS `web.test_request`, which is the executable half of probe C4:
// the call completes with no socket, no port, and no network syscall, and its
// result is readable as `res.status` / `res.body`.
//
// WP3's own contract is the in-memory ROUND TRIP and the response LIFETIME: the
// facade returns whatever the internal response holds, and it must NOT fabricate
// a 200 or echo the path. That contract is unchanged by WP4 and is still
// asserted below.
//
// AMENDED IN WP4. WP4 wired dispatch, so `web.app()` now installs the automatic
// 404/405 and an unmatched path is a real routed 404 — the WP4 tests own that.
// The two round-trip tests below therefore use `web.bare()`, which routes but
// installs no automatic response (D4), so the CORE still commits nothing for an
// unmatched path — keeping these tests distinct from the WP4 404 tests.
//
// AMENDED IN WP8. HTTP cannot send a zero status, so the response DRIVER
// finalizes an uncommitted response to a logged 500 (WP8 D5) — in
// `test_request` exactly as in the real transport. The round trip, the
// no-fabricated-200 rule and the response LIFETIME (both readable until
// `destroy`) are what WP3 ratified and are all still asserted; only the
// observed status/body of an uncommitted response changed.
//
// The matching NEGATIVE contract — that `Recorded_Response` has no public
// `headers` field — cannot be written here, since it must fail to compile. It
// lives in `probes/`, driven by build/check.sh.
