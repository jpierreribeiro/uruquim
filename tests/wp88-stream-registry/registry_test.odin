// WP88/WP89 — registry and cross-lane delivery, beyond the corpus.
//
// The WP87 corpus fixes the single-thread contract; this suite proves the
// pieces the corpus could not see: the ring store's wraparound accounting,
// the process-wide byte budget, the executor-agnostic wake hook, FIFO
// integrity under real concurrent producers, and the owner-lane consumption
// pair (next_event/complete_event) that WP90's writer will drive.
