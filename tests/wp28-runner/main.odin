// WP28 — the shootout runner. Six representations, measured against each other.
//
// It reports numbers and chooses nothing. The choice is made in
// `planning/router-shootout.md`, from these numbers plus the stopping rule
// FINDING-E derived: **the cardinalities where this machine can discriminate
// are 500 and 5,000.** At 5 routes the p95 spread of unchanged code is ±57.6%,
// so a candidate "winning" there by 20% has won nothing measurable.
//
// The alternating order is the same as WP26's and for the same reason: the
// outer loop is the repetition, the inner loops are the configuration and the
// candidate. Measuring all ten repetitions of one candidate back to back would
// hand it a warm cache for its whole block and the next candidate a cold one,
// and the measured difference would be the order.
//
// Correctness is NOT checked here — `tests/wp28-shootout` does that in the
// gate, and this program refuses to be the place where a wrong answer looks
// fast.
