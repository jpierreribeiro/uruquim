// WP27 — the allocation audit. Where does per-request allocation actually go?
//
// RG-3's question, and the three items the post-Phase-1 audit named:
//
//   A-8   inbound headers are allocated and copied every request
//         (`planning/post-phase1-audit.md:83`)
//   A-12  static response headers are `strings.clone`d every request although
//         `response.odin` states they are static strings (:92)
//   A-13  `Header_Pair` and `transport.Header` are structurally identical, and
//         two O(n) conversions run per request purely to satisfy the one-way
//         boundary — "the honest price of ADR-009" (:93)
//
// WP27's scope is MEASURE AND DECIDE. Fixing belongs to WP29 and WP35, where a
// change can be regression-tested against the WP26 baseline. Nothing in this
// suite changes behaviour.
//
// WHY THIS IS AN INTERNAL SUITE. Two of the three procedures under measurement
// are `@(private)` — `inbound_header_pairs` and
// `response_headers_neutral_transport` both live in `web/serve.odin` and are
// not nameable from outside the package. Measuring them through a public
// surface would mean measuring something else and calling it these.
//
// THE PERIMETER, and it is not C-5's. Phase-2 claim C-5 says dispatch through a
// middleware chain allocates zero bytes, measured around
// `driver_run`/`driver_cleanup` and explicitly NOT around `test_request`. That
// claim is about THE CHAIN WALK. Everything measured here sits OUTSIDE the
// chain walk — on the request-construction and response-copy edges of the same
// pipeline — so nothing here contradicts C-5, and no number here may be quoted
// as if it did. C-5's own "does NOT guarantee" line already says the request as
// a whole allocates.

// THE CORRECTION, and the reason WP27 exists rather than a patch.
//
// A-12 says the response headers are static strings, so cloning them is waste.
// The FIRST half is true only for some of them, and the second half would be a
// use-after-free if acted on for the rest:
//
//   * `Content-Type` — name and value are both compile-time constants in
//     `web/response.odin`. Aliasing them would be safe.
//   * `Allow` — the NAME is a constant; the VALUE is built into
//     `Context_Internal.allow_buffer`, a fixed array that dies with the
//     request. Aliasing it would hand the transport a view into freed memory.
//   * `X-Request-Id` — the same: constant name, value in
//     `Context_Internal.request_id_buffer`.
//
// So "stop cloning static headers" is not a change that can be made by knowing
// the header is static — it can only be made by knowing which STRING is. The
// pair would have to carry that knowledge, which is a design change and not an
// optimisation. This test pins the distinction so the next person does not
// apply the audit item literally and ship a dangling view.
