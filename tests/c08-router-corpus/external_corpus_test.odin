// No httprouter CODE is copied. What is adapted is the SHAPE OF ITS TEST CASES:
// which route sets are worth registering and which paths are worth asking about.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// WHY THIS IS A NEGATIVE CORPUS, and it is the whole point of C-08.
//
// The obvious thing to do with another router's tests is to check that you agree
// with it. That would be exactly wrong here. Uruquim's routing semantics differ
// from httprouter's DELIBERATELY, in three places, and each difference is a
// decision with a security or predictability argument behind it. So the corpus
// is run in order to prove that **every difference is intentional and pinned** —
// a regression toward httprouter's behaviour must fail this file.
//
// The three deliberate differences, each with its own section below:
//
//   1. PRECEDENCE. httprouter FORBIDS a static and a parameter route at the same
//      position ("conflicts with existing wildcard"). Uruquim allows both:
//      static wins, WITH CONTROLLED BACKTRACKING. `/users/me/settings` and
//      `/users/:id/profile` may coexist, and `/users/me/profile` must abandon
//      the static branch and succeed on the parameter branch. A literal port of
//      httprouter's tree would break this.
//
//   2. AUTOMATIC PATH CORRECTION. httprouter offers trailing-slash redirection
//      and case/`..`/`//` "path cleaning" that answers 301. Uruquim REJECTS and
//      never repairs: `/users` is not `/users/`, matching is case-sensitive, and
//      `..`, `.`, `//`, `%2F` and `%00` are refused BEFORE routing. A normaliser
//      that gets it wrong produces a path the check already approved — the
//      reason this is policy and not preference.
//
//   3. CATCH-ALL. httprouter has `*filepath`. Uruquim has no catch-all in the
//      router; static file serving is a MOUNT that owns its prefix entirely. A
//      catch-all is possibly useful later (gateways, SPA fallback) and is
//      evidence-gated, not forgotten.
//
// WHAT URUQUIM ALREADY HAS and need not borrow: automatic HEAD and OPTIONS, 405
// with a frozen-order `Allow`, alloc-free per-request params, and conflict
// diagnostics that refuse `/users/:id` beside `/users/:uid` at boot.
