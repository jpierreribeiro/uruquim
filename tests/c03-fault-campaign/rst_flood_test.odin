// C-03 — the RST-flood liveness wedge, reproduced.
//
// THE INHERITED FINDING. `docs/reports/2026-07-23-security-f001-f002.md` closed
// F-002 (a use-after-free through a deferred dispatch) and recorded, as
// explicitly out of scope, a remaining defect:
//
//	"Under a SUSTAINED RST flood the server stops accepting (all threads alive,
//	 listen backlog fills, no crash) — a liveness wedge in the vendored
//	 lane/accept machinery."
//
// The Closure owns it (production-readiness-closure.md §4), and owning it means
// MEASURING it before fixing it. A wedge described in prose has one mechanism
// in the reader's head and possibly another in the process; this suite decides
// which, by driving the flood and probing liveness at the same time.
//
// THE TWO CANDIDATE MECHANISMS, both visible from the C-01 inventory, and they
// call for opposite fixes:
//
//	(a) THE ADMISSION SLOT IS HELD FOR 500 ms AFTER THE PEER IS GONE.
//	    `connection_close` shuts the send side, arms `Conn_Close_Delay` (500 ms,
//	    "so the client can fully receive the response" — RFC 7230 6.6), and only
//	    then closes; `active_connections` is decremented in
//	    `connection_teardown`, at the END of that chain. So a connection whose
//	    peer has ALREADY sent RST — where there is nobody left to be polite to —
//	    still occupies one of `max_connections - reserved_conns` slots for half
//	    a second. A flood only has to open connections faster than
//	    budget / 500 ms to make every subsequent client hit the admission
//	    refusal. The server is then alive, accepting, and refusing everyone.
//
//	(b) THE ACCEPT RE-ARM IS DELAYED BY 10 ms PER TRANSIENT FAILURE.
//	    An RST that arrives before `accept` returns produces `ECONNABORTED`.
//	    Patch 21 tolerates it by re-arming after `URUQUIM_ACCEPT_RETRY_DELAY`
//	    (10 ms). Under a sustained flood most accepts can fail this way, so each
//	    lane spends 10 ms not accepting per failure — an accept rate of roughly
//	    100/s/lane, and the listen backlog fills behind it.
//
// (a) predicts refusals with a healthy accept rate; (b) predicts connect
// timeouts with a filling backlog. They are distinguishable by what the probe
// sees, which is why the probe records the FAILURE KIND and not just a count.
//
// METHOD. Real sockets, a bounded flood, and a probe that runs THROUGHOUT and
// again AFTER — because a wedge that recovers the moment the flood stops is a
// capacity effect, and one that persists is a wedge. Numbers are printed
// whatever the verdict: the measurement is the deliverable even when it passes.

// The flood's own constants. The harness (Server, start_server, dial,

// A SMALL admission budget on purpose. The wedge is a ratio — flood rate
// against budget over the close delay — so shrinking the budget reaches it with
// a flood a test machine can produce without becoming a load generator. With
// 64 - 4 = 60 slots and a 500 ms close delay, mechanism (a) predicts saturation
// above roughly 120 connections per second; the measured flood ran three
// hundred times faster than that.
