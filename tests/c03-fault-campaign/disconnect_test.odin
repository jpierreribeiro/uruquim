// These are the cells the grid (`planning/closure-fault-campaign.md`) found
// empty. Each is a state a client or a shutdown can produce that no existing
// suite drove, and each one is here because "it probably works" is the sentence
// that let the orphaned recv and the write deadline survive.
//
// ONE SERVER PER PROCESS. `web.serve` holds the WP43 `g_server`, so every test
// in this package starts and stops its own server SEQUENTIALLY; the gate runs
// this directory with `-define:ODIN_TEST_THREADS=1`. Under the parallel runner
// one test's `web.stop` would shut down another's server.
//
// The harness (`Server`, `start_server`, `dial`, `send_all`, `abort_close`) is
// shared with `rst_flood_test.odin`, which owns cell A10.

// B4 — every Handler lane busy when a request arrives.
//
// THE TRIGGER IS F-C01-3'S SPIN, and that is worth stating because it explains
// why this test is written as a property rather than as a forced sequence.
// `dispatch_exchange` can only find `td.handler_active` already true if the
// event loop ticked while a handler was running on that lane — and the ONE
// place the loop ticks with a handler active is `handler_lane_enter`'s
// unbounded wait for the cancelled accept's completion (C-01 finding F-C01-3).
// The 503 refusal is therefore reachable only inside a narrow window, so
// forcing it deterministically would mean instrumenting the server, and an
// instrumented server is not the one that ships.
//
// What CAN be asserted without a forced sequence is the property that matters:
// under contention every answer is a well-formed 200 or a well-formed 503 —
// never a hang, never a truncated reply, never a crash — and the server serves
// normally afterwards. That is the F-002 fix's actual contract, and before this
// test it was held only by an ad-hoc validation recorded in a report.
