// WP21 real-socket contract — the fault-behaviour guarantee OVER THE WIRE.
//
// The Phase-2 Test Gate item is explicit that the guarantee must hold "under
// BOTH `web.serve` and `web.test_request`". WP8 proved the in-memory half and
// opened a real socket, but never drove a FAULTING request across it: the
// socket suite only ever asked for responses a handler produced. This suite
// closes that gap, because the gate item is worth exactly as much as its
// weaker transport.
//
// It asserts three things a socket can show and memory cannot:
//
//   1. an uncommitted response becomes a real `HTTP/1.1 500` status line with
//      the standardized envelope as its body — a zero status has no wire
//      representation at all, so this is where a missing guarantee would show
//      up as a malformed or empty reply;
//   2. the bytes are IDENTICAL to what `web.test_request` returns for the same
//      request — R-10, on the one property most worth keeping identical;
//   3. a second fault on a fresh connection is answered identically, and a
//      healthy request between them is unaffected. A server that faults once
//      and then degrades is the failure mode this excludes.
//
// The serve thread is given an EXPLICIT context carrying a quiet logger: the
// framework emits one Error-level `uruquim:` diagnostic per finalized fault,
// and the test runner treats an Error line as a failure. Non-framework lines
// are still forwarded, so a genuine failure can still be reported.
//
// build/check.sh runs this under an EXTERNAL timeout like every socket suite: a
// `serve` that blocked instead of answering would hang, and a hang is a
// FAILURE, never a stalled gate.
