# Operating Uruquim

**Who this is for:** whoever has to deploy this and be woken up by it.

It says what is bounded, what is not, what to monitor, and — the section most
documents leave out — **what this framework does not protect you from.** A
deployment guide that only lists features is a guide that gets someone paged.

---

## 1. The supported topology

**Behind a reverse proxy, under a supervisor.** Both halves are load-bearing.

```
    internet → reverse proxy (TLS) → Uruquim (HTTP) → your handlers
                                        ↑
                                   supervisor
```

**Why a proxy.** Uruquim does not terminate TLS and will not: in-process TLS
would import an enormous attack surface into a framework whose value is a small,
frozen, gate-enforced one. The proxy holds the certificate, and it is also the
thing that should assert HSTS — a framework behind it asserting HSTS on a
cleartext hop is asserting something it cannot know.

**Why a supervisor, and this is not a nicety.** **A faulting handler aborts the
process.** Odin has no recoverable panic (ADR-020), so a nil dereference, a
failed assertion or an out-of-bounds index in your handler ends the program. The
supervisor restarting it *is* the recovery mechanism. There is no other one and
there will not be.

`systemd` is the ordinary answer:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/your-app
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
```

**This is also how Gin is deployed in practice.** The difference is that this
document writes the boundary down instead of leaving it folklore.

## 2. What the framework bounds

Set these explicitly rather than inheriting them, because a default you did not
choose is a default you will not remember under load:

```odin
budget := web.DEFAULT_LIMITS
budget.max_body         = 1 * 1024 * 1024   // 4 MiB default
budget.max_request_time = 10 * 1_000_000_000 // 30 s default, nanoseconds
budget.max_connections  = 512                // 1024 default
budget.max_handlers     = 8                  // 0 = bounded automatic policy
web.limits(&app, budget)
```

| Bound | Default | What happens at the limit |
|---|---|---|
| `max_body` | 4 MiB | `413`, before the parser and before any arena |
| `max_request_line` | 8000 | the backend refuses the request |
| `max_headers` | 8000 | the backend refuses the request |
| `max_request_time` | 30 s | **the connection is closed** — this is the slowloris defence |
| `max_write_time` | `0` = off | **the connection is reset (RST)** — a graceful close would flush kernel buffers to the slow reader first and hide the deadline; the reset is the observable, honest end (WP90 / ADR-039) |
| `max_idle_time` | `0` = off | the idle keep-alive connection is **closed gracefully**; the clock stops the moment the next request's bytes arrive |
| `max_connections` | 1024 | the connection is **closed at accept**, not queued |
| `reserved_conns` | 16 | slots held back from admission so a shutdown always has room |
| `max_handlers` | `0` = auto | synchronous Handler capacity; auto resolves from CPU count, bounded to 4..32 |

**`max_request_time` is a REQUEST deadline, not an idle timeout.** An idle timer
is reset by every byte, so a client trickling one byte per second resets it
forever — which is precisely the attack. This bounds the total time a request
may take to *arrive*.

**It does not bound your handler.** A slow handler is your program's time, and
killing its connection would turn a slow page into a broken one.

### Handler concurrency

Handlers may run concurrently. The default `max_handlers = 0` selects a
bounded automatic capacity: processor count clamped to 4..32. Set it to `1`
for deterministic compatibility with deliberately single-threaded application
state, or to an explicit value up to 256 when capacity planning requires it.

This is **Handler capacity**, not a promise about backend threads. Slow socket
reads and writes remain asynchronous and do not consume a Handler unit. A
blocking database call consumes one unit; health remains live while at least
one unit is free. Full saturation is an explicit boundary, not hidden
preemption.

`App_State` is application-owned. Mutable values shared by Handlers need a
lock, atomics or a thread-safe service; immutable configuration does not.

---

## 3. What the framework does NOT bound — read this section twice

| Not bounded | Who owns it |
|---|---|
| **your handler's own allocations** | you |
| **your response body's size** | you |
| **how long your handler runs** | you |
| the accept **backlog** | the kernel |
| inbound header **count** (the block's bytes are bounded) | the transport |
| total process memory | the OS — set a cgroup limit |
| middleware chain **depth** | you; ~100k frames, and exceeding it is a **segfault, not a diagnostic** |

**Uruquim bounds its own per-request working memory. It does not bound the
server.** Any sentence that says "bounded" without naming which perimeter is a
sentence this project's gate exists to prevent.

---

## 4. Shutdown, and its sharp edge

```odin
web.stop(&app)   // returns immediately; safe from a signal handler
```

`stop` ends admission and lets in-flight work finish; `web.serve` returns when
the drain completes.

**Wire it to a signal yourself — the core does not.** A rolling deploy sends
`SIGTERM`; nothing drains unless your `main` installs a handler that calls
`web.stop`. The core installs none deliberately: seizing process signals fights
your supervisor. The canonical shape (full program in
`examples/09-graceful-shutdown`):

```odin
app: web.App   // package global: a signal handler gets only the signal

on_signal :: proc "c" (_: posix.Signal) {
	context = runtime.default_context()
	web.stop(&app)   // async-signal-safe: an atomic flag plus a wake-up
}

main :: proc() {
	app = web.app()
	defer web.destroy(&app)
	// ... routes ...
	posix.signal(.SIGTERM, on_signal)
	posix.signal(.SIGINT, on_signal)
	web.serve(&app, 8080)   // returns after the signal drains it
}
```

**Readiness during drain: `web.is_draining(&app)`.** So a load balancer stops
routing to an instance that is shutting down, a readiness endpoint must answer
not-ready the moment the drain begins:

```odin
web.get(&app, "/ready", proc(ctx: ^web.Context) {
	if web.is_draining(&app) {
		web.text(ctx, web.Status(503), "draining")
		return
	}
	web.text(ctx, .OK, "ready")
})
```

`is_draining` is `false` before `stop`, `true` after, and never returns to
`false`. Keep it distinct from liveness (`/health`, which stays 200 as long as
the process can answer at all): liveness tells the supervisor whether to
restart; readiness tells the proxy whether to route.

**`stop` has a deadline: `Limits.max_drain_time`, ten seconds by default.**
When it expires, connections still serving a request are closed rather than
waited for, and `web.serve` returns.

This shipped in WP59 and it is worth knowing what it replaced, because the
history is the reason to trust it. WP44 attempted the same field, measured a
drain that never terminated, and **withdrew it rather than ship a field that did
not bound anything.** WP58 then measured why, and found something worse than a
missing deadline: with idle keep-alive connections the drain never ended, and
letting those connections complete **crashed the process** on a connection the
shutdown path had already freed. Both failures came from one pending read that
nothing could cancel. Cancelling it fixed both.

**What it does not bound, and this has not changed:**

> **⚠ A blocking handler can outlive the drain deadline.** A synchronous
> Handler cannot be preempted; it holds its Handler lane until it returns.
> `max_drain_time` cannot unwind arbitrary user or C code.

**So the advice is narrower than it was, not absent:**

* set `max_request_time` — it bounds how long a stuck *request* survives;
* **keep the supervisor's kill timeout as your outer bound.** `systemd`'s
  `TimeoutStopSec` should be longer than `max_drain_time` and shorter than your
  orchestrator's grace period. The default of ten seconds is chosen to sit
  inside both;
* set `max_drain_time = 0` to get the old unbounded behaviour back, if you would
  rather wait than cut a request off.

**A blocking handler still outlives the drain if it does not return.** Other
lanes can continue and observe stop, but teardown cannot free state still used
by arbitrary application code. The supervisor remains the outer bound.

---

## 5. One server per process

`web.serve` blocks and the transport keeps per-process state. **Two servers in
one process is not supported.** Scale horizontally: one process per server, many
processes.

The server uses **bounded synchronous Handler concurrency**. Slow socket I/O
remains asynchronous; application code occupies one Handler unit until it
returns. `max_handlers = 0` derives a bounded 4..32 capacity from the processor
count, while `1` preserves the former deterministic compatibility model.

This is for ordinary blocking dependencies, not a CPU scheduler. If handlers
are CPU-bound, size `max_handlers` deliberately and scale with more processes.

---

## 6. What to monitor

```odin
web.refused_connections()   // running total of admission refusals
web.observe(&app, on_framework_error)
web.use(&app, web.logger)
web.use(&app, web.request_id)
```

* **`refused_connections()` is your saturation signal.** It rising means you are
  at `max_connections`. Zero means either nothing was refused or no server is
  running — those are deliberately not distinguished.
* **`observe`** receives a typed event for every framework-detected failure.
  It cannot change the response; it is for exporting to metrics or alerting.
* **Key every metric on `web.route(ctx)`, never on `ctx.request.path`.** The
  path has unbounded cardinality — one time series per user id — and it puts
  user data in a dashboard.

**What the framework will never log:** the path, the query, any header, any body
byte, any parameter. It records the route pattern, the method, the status, the
request ID, a closed error enum and its own counts. Nothing else
(`planning/phase-4-spec.md` §3).

---

## 7. Behind a proxy: the client address

```odin
web.trust_proxies(&app, {"10.", "127.0.0.1"})
ip := web.client_ip(ctx)
```

**`client_ip` returns the connected peer unless that peer is one you named.**
Only then is `X-Forwarded-For` believed.

**Never read `X-Forwarded-For` yourself.** It is a request header — any client
can send one — and a rate limit, audit log or allow-list built on a forged value
is an authorization bypass. If you configure nothing, you get the peer, which
behind a proxy is the proxy: correct, if not what you wanted, and safe.

---

## 8. Security posture

```odin
web.use(&app, web.secure_headers)   // nosniff, DENY, no-referrer
```

**There is no CSP and no HSTS**, deliberately. A CSP not written for your
application breaks it; HSTS belongs to whatever terminates TLS. Set both **at
your proxy**, where they can be written against your actual deployment.

**There is no cookie API**, so there is nothing to secure with `SameSite` — if
you set cookies, you set the headers, and you own their attributes.

---

## 8b. Response streaming and SSE (Phase 7)

Streaming is **opt-in** and adds no concept to ordinary buffered endpoints. A
Handler that never calls `web.stream` links none of the machinery.

**Lifetime and ownership.** `web.stream(ctx, content_type)` detaches a
long-lived response from the request; the Handler then RETURNS. Everything the
detached stream touches must OUTLIVE the Handler — so **stream-lifetime state
lives in `App_State` or an application-owned allocation, never in the request
arena**, which is destroyed the moment the Handler returns (that destruction is
the whole point of detachment). The `web.Stream` token is a stale-safe value: a
copy held past the stream's life targets nothing and its send/close refuse.

```text
Handler: s, ok := web.stream(ctx, "text/event-stream"); store s in App_State; RETURN
worker : web.stream_send(s, bytes)   // from any thread; copies; never blocks
worker : web.stream_close(s)         // graceful: flushes queued output, then ends
```

**Queue sizing and the slow-client policy.** Each stream has a bounded queue
(64 events / 256 KiB by default) and the process a 16 MiB total. `stream_send`
returns `Full` when the queue is full — it never blocks; the application chooses
to retry, drop or coalesce. A client that never reads is disconnected at
`max_write_time` (a detached stream defaults it to 30 s even when the global
setting is off, because an infinite response must not be unbounded). Refusals
and slow-aborts are counted, not logged per event.

**Graceful close.** `web.stream_close` delivers the events already queued before
it, then the terminating chunk — so an application may send a final message and
close immediately without losing it.

**Behind a proxy.** The framework produces chunked output a non-buffering proxy
forwards frame by frame. A BUFFERING proxy is the failure mode to configure
away, not a framework behaviour: on nginx set `proxy_buffering off;` (or send
`X-Accel-Buffering: no`) for the SSE location, disable response buffering, and
raise `proxy_read_timeout` past your heartbeat interval. `Last-Event-ID` crosses
an ordinary proxy unchanged. Send a heartbeat comment (`: ping`) periodically so
idle-timeout proxies keep the connection open.

**SSE and reconnection.** SSE is a Crystal (`crystals:web/sse`) over this
surface, not a core concept. A reconnecting client replays its cursor in
`Last-Event-ID`; the application decides what to resend from it — the core
carries the header, it does not replay events.

**Large uploads.** The buffered path (`web.body`, `form_file`, up to
`max_body`) is unchanged and canonical. A bounded spool substrate for bodies
larger than memory exists internally (fragmentation-correct multipart, generated
`uruquim-spool-` files at `0600`, per-upload/process quotas, exactly-once
cleanup) but has **no public upload API yet** — see §10. When it ships, temp
files are deleted on every non-persisted path; the operator's only concern is
crash remnants, which carry the `uruquim-spool-` prefix.

**After first-byte commit**, framework 4xx/5xx responders cannot append a second
envelope, and the adapter that carries this must be replaceable: every streaming
hook in the vendored backend is a numbered `BRIDGE` patch, deletable when
`core:net/http` lands.

## 9. A deployment checklist

1. Reverse proxy in front, terminating TLS, with its own timeouts and body caps.
2. Supervisor with `Restart=always` and a `TimeoutStopSec` you chose.
3. `web.limits` set explicitly, including `max_connections` below your
   file-descriptor limit.
4. `web.trust_proxies` naming your proxy's network — or nothing at all, never a
   guess.
5. `web.secure_headers` on, CSP and HSTS at the proxy.
6. `web.logger` and `web.request_id` on; `web.observe` exporting to wherever you
   alert from.
7. A cgroup memory limit, because the framework does not bound your handlers.
8. Metrics keyed on `web.route`, never on the path.
9. One process per server; scale by adding processes.
10. Load-test **your** handlers. This framework's dispatch is flat from 5 routes
    to 5,000; your database is not.

---

## 10. Known limitations, in one place

* **No TLS**, by decision. Use a proxy.
* **A blocking Handler cannot be preempted.** `max_drain_time` bounds transport
  shutdown and `max_request_time` bounds arrival; neither interrupts arbitrary
  application or foreign code. Other Handler lanes retain progress until the
  configured capacity is saturated.
* **A faulting handler aborts the process.** By construction, not by defect.
* **No WebSocket or arbitrary full-duplex.** Response streaming and SSE cover
  server push; a bidirectional product that cannot fit SSE is out of core by
  decision (evidence-gated, not yet built).
* **Large-body upload has a substrate but no public API yet.** The spool +
  streaming multipart parser are implemented and tested internally (Phase-7
  WP93/WP94), but the public upload contract that wires them into the request
  path is deferred — large uploads remain buffered under `max_body` until it
  ships. The response-streaming direction is fully public (`web.stream`).
* **The 3,000-concurrent-stream drain is proven on the registry in memory**,
  and on the wire at modest count; a 3,000 *real-socket* round awaits a
  dedicated quiet CI machine and is recorded as the one scale claim not yet
  demonstrated end to end on hardware.
* **The write deadline and idle timeout default OFF.** `max_write_time` and
  `max_idle_time` exist (WP90 / ADR-039) but ship disabled: a default generous
  enough for every legitimate slow link is a judgement the application must
  make, and a framework-chosen number would reset real clients on upgrade.
  Enable both in production, sized to your slowest legitimate client.
* **No bound on the accept backlog or inbound header count.**
* **One server per process.**
* **No WebSocket or streaming.** Out of core by decision, and both need a
  response model this framework does not have (ADR-014 buffers responses
  whole). CORS, static files and uploads were on this list until Phase 5 moved
  them into the core (ADR-034).
* **Uploads are bounded by `max_body` and held in memory.** A file larger than
  that is refused with 413 before your handler runs. There is no setting that
  makes a 2 GB upload work — the body is held whole, so raising `max_body`
  raises what one request can cost. **If you need large uploads, terminate them
  at a proxy or an object store and hand the application a reference.** The
  framework will not spool to disk, and a version that pretended to would be
  spooling into RAM.
* **Static files are served whole, with no ranges and no `Last-Modified`.**
  `ETag`/`If-None-Match` work and answer 304. A file above
  `Static_Options.max_file_size` is answered 404. Every symlink is refused
  whatever it points at, and so is any path containing `..`, `%`, a backslash,
  a NUL, an empty segment, or a segment starting with `.`.
* **A CORS misconfiguration fails at boot, not at runtime.** `*` with
  credentials, `*` beside named origins, and `*` in the header list with
  credentials are all refused by `web.cors`, and the application will not
  start.
* **The HTTP server underneath is a vendored snapshot of `laytan/odin-http`,
  which describes itself as beta.** A set of local patches is carried (see planning/vendor-policy.md), several of
  them fixing upstream defects — including one that broke keep-alive for every
  GET, and one use-after-free on the shutdown path.
  `planning/vendor-policy.md` governs them. **This is scheduled to end:** Odin's
  standard library gains an official `core:net/http` in January 2027, and
  ADR-033 now points at swapping to it rather than owning a connection layer.
  The streaming and drain patches are marked `BRIDGE` and are expected to be
  deleted rather than ported.
