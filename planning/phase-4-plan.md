# Phase 4 — Production: work package plan

**Status: DRAFT, written 2026-07-20 — before Phase 3 has run, and on purpose.**
The shape of Phase 4 is already fixed by research that Phase 3 cannot change
(C-1…C-8 and the RG-P4 gates in `later-phases-plan.md`), so writing the shape
now costs nothing and lets the Phase-3 agent see where its outputs land. The
details Phase 3 **will** change are collected in §0 as a mandatory refresh, and
E-4 makes that refresh an entry condition. **Nothing here freezes a signature**
— precision about unstarted work would be false precision, and this plan does
not pretend to it.

Work packages continue the numbering: **WP39 – WP56**, mapping the
`P4-1 … P4-20` slots (with the consolidations §4 records).
`later-phases-plan.md` stays authoritative for the research findings; this
plan supersedes its Phase-4 table for sequencing and scope.

The theme in one line: **make deployment defensible — this is the phase where
mistakes stop being inconvenient and become remotely exploitable, so
fail-closed stops being a preference and becomes the whole method.**

---

## 0. The hand-over: what WP38 must deliver into this plan

Mandatory refresh, applied and recorded before any Phase-4 package starts
(that is E-4). Each row names what can invalidate what.

| Phase-3 output | What in this plan it feeds or can change |
|---|---|
| WP36's options struct and derived `Server_Runtime` | WP46 builds **on** it — connection, queue and ingress limits become new rows in the same boot-derivation, never a second mechanism. If the shape shipped differently, WP46 is amended first. |
| WP35's arena policy and the R-16 outcome | WP54's audit baseline — and whether **slot reuse exists at all**, which decides if generational tokens are in scope (P-T7's rule: no reuse, no abstraction). |
| WP29's router representation | Feeds WP41's fault menu (what conflict diagnostics exist to trip) — by design it changes nothing else here, because it was internal-only. |
| WP34's route identity accessor | WP50 depends on it existing; observability keys on the pattern, never the path. |
| FINDING-A's status on the then-pinned toolchain | Every measurement methodology in WP53; if the toolchain was re-pinned, the nondeterminism finding is re-verified, not inherited. |
| The concept-budget headroom after WP38's lab re-run | The budget WP44's public stop/shutdown surface spends from. |
| Any ADR accepted or amended during Phase 3 | The §2b table below is re-checked row by row. |

---

## 0b. The hand-over, APPLIED — E-4 discharged 2026-07-20

Phase 3 is frozen (`planning/phase-3-freeze.md`, ledger 50 + 2 = 52). Every row
of §0 is re-checked below against what actually shipped, which is what E-4 asked
for. **A plan that skips its refresh is folklore with a section number.**

| §0 row | What Phase 3 actually delivered | Effect on this plan |
|---|---|---|
| WP36's options struct and derived runtime | Shipped as designed: `Limits` + `DEFAULT_LIMITS` constant + boot-derived, validated once, copied onto each request. **But with three BYTE budgets and no time budget.** | **WP46 is amended** (§3): it inherits the mechanism unchanged AND gains read/write deadlines as new rows in it (ADR-031). No second mechanism. |
| WP35's arena policy and R-16 | The decision was to change nothing; **no slot reuse exists.** | **WP54 loses its generational-token contingency.** P-T7's rule applies literally: no reuse, no abstraction. It returns only if Phase 4 introduces reuse. |
| WP29's router representation | Internal-only, as predicted — and WP30 added registration-conflict poisoning on top of it. | **WP41's fault menu gains a row**: a conflict diagnostic is now a trippable boot failure, not only a dispatch outcome. |
| WP34's route identity accessor | Shipped as `web.route(ctx)`, with the pattern-never-path rule enforced at every write to the slot. | **WP50 may depend on it**, and inherits the gate assertion rather than restating the rule. |
| FINDING-A on the pinned toolchain | Re-verified and **worse than recorded**: the WP26 harness derived a tolerance floor of **13,821 bp (138%)** on this machine, and binary size quantises at roughly a 4 KiB page. | **WP53 inherits a hard constraint:** any Phase-4 performance claim needs a paired-run design or a quieter machine. A single-figure comparison is not evidence here, and WP47's "rejection is cheaper than admitted work" claim is the first one this bites. |
| Concept-budget headroom after WP38 | Guarded lab program at **23 of 25**. | **WP44 has two concepts of headroom for the entire stop/shutdown surface.** That is the budget, and it is tight on purpose — see §2b. |
| Any ADR accepted or amended in Phase 3 | ADR-028 ACCEPTED (option 1, no request-scoped state); ADR-029 delegation in force; **ADR-031 accepted here.** | §2b re-checked row by row below; two rows amended, one added. |

**One row of §0 turned out to be missing, and it is recorded rather than
quietly added:** nothing in §0 anticipated that Phase 3 would ship a *hole*
(timeouts) rather than a shape. The hand-over table assumed Phase 3's outputs
would feed Phase 4; it had no row for a Phase-3 output that Phase 4 must
**repair**. ADR-031 is that repair, and future phase plans should carry a
"what did the previous phase leave undone" row explicitly.

## 1. Entry conditions (not work packages)

| ID | Item | Status, 2026-07-20 |
|---|---|---|
| E-1 | Phase 3 frozen — WP38 merged, full gate green on `main` | ✅ **met** — `planning/phase-3-freeze.md`, ledger 50 + 2 = 52 |
| E-2 | Configurable limits and timeouts exist (WP36 shipped) — the roadmap's hard dependency: shutdown with a deadline is meaningless without timeouts | ⚠️ **HALF MET, and this is the one that had to be decided.** Limits shipped; **timeouts did not.** See the resolution immediately below. |
| E-3 | The full gate exits 0 on `main` at the moment Phase 4 starts | ✅ **met** |
| E-4 | **This plan re-reviewed against §0**, amendments applied and recorded | ✅ **met** — §0b above |

**E-2, resolved 2026-07-20 under the ADR-029 delegation.** The condition was
written expecting WP36 to ship both halves. It shipped one, for a measured
reason. There were two ways to satisfy the condition and only one of them is
honest:

* **Amend E-2 away** — accept that shutdown deadlines come from the reverse
  proxy, and let the entry condition read as met. This was the arm previously
  recommended, on the grounds that it is reversible and ships nothing.
* **Satisfy E-2 by building the missing half.** ← **chosen (ADR-031).**

The deciding argument is not preference, it is what the condition was *for*.
E-2 exists because *"shutdown with a deadline is meaningless without
timeouts"* — and that reasoning does not care where the timeout comes from
until you notice that **a proxy's read timeout cannot drain the framework's own
in-flight work.** The proxy can stop feeding the process; it cannot tell WP44's
shutdown that a handler has been running for four minutes. Delegating the
deadline delegates the *defence* while leaving the *lifecycle* without the
clock it was specified against.

So E-2 is met **by construction rather than by exception**: WP46 grows the
deadline rows, WP44 gets a real clock to bound its drain with, and the entry
condition is discharged the way it was written. `E-2 → WP51 → WP46 → WP44` is
the new critical path; see the sequencing amendment in §2c.

**And the foundation itself became the question (ADR-033).** Checking the
upstream to see whether a timeout could be contributed there turned up the
larger fact: `laytan/odin-http` describes itself as *beta software* whose author
*"does not hesitate to push API changes"*. Combined with the observation that
**WP44–WP47 and WP52 are all server work rather than framework work**, that
makes "keep, patch, or own the transport" the real Phase-4 decision, and WP41 —
already first in the sequence — is where the evidence for it arrives. Recorded
as ADR-033, OPEN with its criteria fixed in advance.

**Amended the same day (ADR-031 Amendment 1).** The first version of this
resolution also fixed the MECHANISM — patch the vendored connection read. That
was decided before WP41 exists to say how that server behaves, and it was
reached partly from an inferred design constraint rather than from evidence.
**The requirement stands and the mechanism returns to WP46**, where upstreaming
is attempted first and a carried patch is the fallback. The comparison that
settles the framing: **Gin does not implement timeouts either** — they come from
`net/http`'s server. The gap here is a foundation gap, not a framework-design
gap, and the fix belongs at the foundation.

## 2. Work package sequence

| WP | P4 | Name | Type | Approval |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 39 | RG-P4-A | Lifecycle state machine | SPEC | resolved (§2b) |
| 40 | RG-P4-B | Capacity and overload ledger | SPEC | resolved (§2b) |
| 41 | RG-P4-C | Deterministic transport fault laboratory | TESTS | resolved (§2b) |
| 42 | P4-1 | Concurrency model | PROTOTYPE + ADR-030 | **deliberately open — see §2b** |
| 43 | P4-3 | Per-server state replaces the transport globals | IMPLEMENTATION | internal only |
| 44 | P4-2 | Lifecycle: stop, shutdown, deadline, cleanup | SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION | resolved in principle (§2b); surface sized at spec time |
| 45 | P4-4 | Connection lifetime: keep-alive, drain-or-close, staged close | IMPLEMENTATION | behaviour per RFC (C-3) |
| 46 | P4-5 | Limits: connections, queue, headers, ingress rate | SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION | builds on WP36; ledger amendment |
| 47 | P4-6 | Deterministic load shedding | IMPLEMENTATION | resolved (§2b) |
| 48 | P4-7 | Trusted proxies | SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION | ADR-013, already accepted in direction |
| 49 | P4-9 | Secure headers and cookies | SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION | forces the D-14.3 header decision |
| 50 | P4-12+13 | Observability with the redaction policy as its spec half | SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION | resolved (§2b) |
| 51 | P4-15 | Vendor maintenance policy | SPEC | resolved (§2b) |
| 52 | P4-16 | Fuzzing and the extended framing corpus | TESTS | resolved (§2b) |
| 53 | P4-17 | Load, soak and fault-injection tests | TESTS | methodology inherits WP26 |
| 54 | P4-18 | Allocator and lifetime audit, whole-system | TESTS | resolved (§2b) |
| 55 | P4-19 | Operations documentation | DOCS | resolved (§2b) |
| 56 | P4-20 | Phase-4 freeze | FREEZE | delegated to the gate, WP38-style |

**Dependencies:** {39, 40, 41} first — the same structural decision as Phase 3,
for the same reason: a production phase that starts by implementing has chosen
its failure modes by taste. Then 42 → {44, 45, 46, 47} (the concurrency
decision shapes all four); 43 → 44 (there is nothing to stop until state is
per-server); 44 → 45; {36 (Phase 3), 40} → 46 → 47; 48, 49, 50 and 51 are
independent of each other once 42 lands; 52 and 53 run against whatever
exists and grow with it; all → 54 → 55 → 56.

---

## 2b. Approvals resolved in advance (ADR-029), and the one that is not

Same regime as the Phase-3 plan's §2b, same condition on every row: **if the
work package's own spec or prototype work contradicts the decided arm, the
agent stops and records the finding instead of proceeding.**

| Matter | Decided arm | Grounds |
|---|---|---|
| **CORS (P4-8), uploads (P4-10), static files (P4-11)** | **Out of core, ratified.** Each becomes an optional package, spec-gated Phase-5 style, and the core never grows them. | Each is a security surface of its own; the recorded constraints (Fetch spec for CORS, OWASP for uploads, traversal/symlinks/ranges for static files) travel with the packages, in `later-phases-plan.md`. The mission keeps the core small; G-04 already said optional means optional. |
| **TLS (P4-14)** | **Reverse-proxy termination is the supported deployment**, documented as such in WP55. In-process TLS is at most a future optional package, unscheduled. | The common deployment is free and removes an enormous attack surface from the core. Terminating TLS in-process would import exactly the class of risk this phase exists to reduce. |
| **Trusted proxies (WP48)** | ADR-013's accepted direction: peer address by default, explicit trust configuration, `Forwarded` never echoed. | Decided 2026-07-20; the fail-closed arm. WP48 owns signatures and the CIDR corpus, not the direction. |
| **The three gates (WP39–41)** | Approved as specs and tests — they add no public surface and no capability. | They are the phase's instruments; refusing them is refusing to look. |
| **WP44 stop/shutdown surface** | Approved **in principle**: real demand exists (there is no way to stop a server today). The exact symbols are sized at spec time under G-09 evidence, smallest surface that gives admission stop, an absolute deadline and exactly-once cleanup. | A promise made now about symbol names would be the false precision this plan refuses. |
| **WP47 shedding** | Deterministic, bounded admission **before** any adaptive controller; rejection measured cheaper than admitted work. | Research item 10 before 11; an adaptive controller on top of unmeasured shedding is two unknowns multiplied. |
| **WP50** | Redaction policy is the spec half and lands **first**; observability keys on the route pattern, never the raw path; drop policy observable. | Separating redaction from observability invites shipping them in the wrong order. Phase 1's "nothing reaches a log line" property is preserved deliberately, not by accident. |
| **WP56 freeze** | Delegated to the gate, WP38-style: freeze if and only if every gate is green, every ledger amended, seeds and soak results recorded. Any breach stops and goes to the owner. | Same reasoning as WP38: criteria met and refused is ceremony; criteria breached and passed is a lie. |
| **Read and write deadlines (ADR-031, as amended)** | **The REQUIREMENT is fixed; the MECHANISM is WP46's to choose, after WP41.** Deadlines are the framework's problem and not the proxy's — but which mechanism (upstream to `odin-http`, a carried vendored patch, or the transport WP42/WP43 leaves behind) is decided with the fault lab's evidence in hand. **Upstream is attempted first; a carried patch is the fallback.** Until it ships, direct exposure without a proxy is not a supported deployment, and WP55 says so. | Byte budgets cannot reach slowloris — the request never gets large, only slow — and a proxy's timeout cannot bound the framework's own in-flight work, which is what WP44 needs a clock for. But the first draft of this row fixed the mechanism *before* the lab existed to say how the server behaves under a slow client, which inverts this project's method. Code we do not own is code we do not maintain; and per-connection timers have cancellation semantics the concurrency decision changes, so building them first means building them twice. |
| **WP42 concurrency — THE OPEN ONE** | **Not pre-resolved, deliberately.** Whether `serve` stays single-threaded by construction is the phase's architectural decision (audit A-4, A-14), and deciding it today, without prototypes, would be taste wearing a delegation. What is written instead is the **procedure**: prototype both arms — the current single-threaded event loop, and a threaded model — measure both under WP53's workloads (including slow-client and slow-writer), and decide by **ADR-030** with the losing arm's numbers recorded. Two constraints bind whichever wins: fail-closed (no shared-mutable `App` state without a guard equivalent to the existing poison mechanism), and the Phase-3 decision that registration after `serve` begins is rejected — WP42 inherits that, it does not reopen it. | C-5's lesson generalises: "real systems use threads" is not evidence about Uruquim's workloads. The mission's tie-breaker applies only after the measurements. |

**WP42 stays open, and the delegation does not change that.** ADR-029 hands over
*approvals*; it does not manufacture *evidence*. Deciding the concurrency model
today would be exactly the "taste wearing a delegation" this row already
refuses, and it would be the one decision in the phase that cannot be walked
back cheaply.

**What IS decided now, because it is decidable without a prototype, is the
default and the stopping rule:**

1. **The default arm is single-threaded** — the status quo, `thread_count = 1`.
   It is what ships today, it is what every existing test and every measured
   number describes, and it is the only arm that is free to abandon.
2. **The burden of proof is on threading.** A threaded model is adopted only if
   WP53's workloads show a material improvement *and* WP41's fault lab shows the
   threaded arm surviving the same seeded faults. "Material" is defined before
   the run, against FINDING-A's re-verified noise floor — which on this machine
   is **138%**, so a threaded arm that wins by 20% has not won anything this
   instrument can see.
3. **An inconclusive prototype means single-threaded.** Written down in advance
   precisely because the temptation at that moment will be to read a wide noise
   band as a mild preference. A tie goes to the arm already shipping.
4. **Two constraints bind either arm** (unchanged): fail-closed — no
   shared-mutable `App` state without a guard equivalent to the existing poison
   mechanism — and the Phase-3 decision that registration after `serve` begins
   is **rejected**. WP42 inherits that; it does not reopen it.

---

## 2c. Sequencing amendment (2026-07-20)

**WP51 moves before WP46.** WP51 is the vendor maintenance policy; ADR-031 makes
WP46 the package that patches the vendored connection read. **A patch that
predates the policy governing patches is how a fork starts** — and this
repository already carries five vendored patches whose behaviour, not text, the
WP9 corpus asserts. That method has to be written down as policy before it is
applied to the hottest code in the tree, not afterwards.

The critical path is therefore: **{39, 40, 41} → 42 → 43 → 51 → 46 → 44 → 45 →
47**, with 48, 49, 50 independent once 42 lands, 52/53 growing alongside, and
all → 54 → 55 → 56.

WP44 moving after WP46 is the second consequence, and it is the point of
ADR-031: shutdown-with-a-deadline is specified against a clock, and now there is
one to specify it against.

---

## 3. The work packages

Concise on purpose — full per-package prose is written at E-4 time, when the
Phase-3 outputs are real. What is fixed now is each package's **contract**:
objective, the research that binds it, and rollback.

### WP39 — Lifecycle state machine (RG-P4-A)

**DONE, 2026-07-20 — `planning/phase-4-spec.md` §1, `build/check_phase4_spec.sh`,
`build/check_wp39_controls.sh`.** Five closed states, five proof obligations,
gate-enforced with eight controls including a positive one.

**Writing the spec before the implementation earned its keep immediately.**
Reading the vendored server rather than assuming it found that a lifecycle
already exists there — `Server_State`, `Connection_State`, `Will_Close`,
one-way transitions, a real drain — **and that its drain loop has NO deadline:
it waits for active connections forever.** So WP44 is not "expose what is
already there"; the deadline is the part that does not exist, and the framework's
`Draining` must impose it AROUND the vendored loop rather than inside it.

**SPEC.** `Configuring → Serving → Draining → Stopped`, plus `→ Failed`, as
**data, not booleans** — the failure this prevents is `stopping`, `draining`
and `failed` as flags admitting combinations no reviewer can enumerate. Same
reasoning that made `Framework_Error` a closed union. Proof obligations that
travel to WP44: admission stop, close-after-send, an absolute deadline, and
cleanup that runs exactly once. **Rollback: HIGH** — a spec ships nothing.

### WP40 — Capacity and overload ledger (RG-P4-B)

**DONE, 2026-07-20 — `planning/phase-4-spec.md` §2.** Nine rows (R-1…R-9), each
answering all five questions, with the fifth column — **reserved for stop** —
parsed by the gate rather than eyeballed, because that is the cell that gets
filled with "n/a" under time pressure. The reservation rule is an inequality on
purpose: **admission is refused at or below the reservation, never at zero.**

**SPEC.** One row per resource — connections, accept queue, ingress, response
buffers, timers — each stating capacity, behaviour when full, the diagnostic,
who owns cleanup, and **the minimum reserved for stop/close**. The reservation
is the point: the fatal failure is not running out of capacity, it is running
out and having none left to shut down with. Rows land in the capacity ledger
at WP56. **Rollback: HIGH.**

### WP41 — Deterministic transport fault laboratory (RG-P4-C)

**DONE, 2026-07-21 — `tests/support/fault_lab/`, `tests/wp41-fault/`,
`build/check_wp41_controls.sh`.** Both halves of the success criterion are met:
**the same seed replays the same trail**, and the lab **found a defect the
existing tests miss.**

**THE FINDING, and it is the evidence ADR-031 and ADR-033 were waiting for.**
Every case in the WP9 corpus is a COMPLETE transmission — bytes arrive, the
parser rejects them, the connection is retired. None of them ever asks what
happens when the bytes simply **stop**. They stop here, and the server:

> never responds, never closes, and holds the connection open until the LAB
> runs out of patience.

Two shapes, both live: a client that sends a valid prefix and says nothing more,
and a client that trickles one byte at a time. **One socket, no bandwidth, held
indefinitely, and nothing counts it, bounds it or ends it.** That is slowloris,
and it is now a test rather than an inference.

**Recorded for ADR-033's decision at this package:** the lab did NOT have to
reach into the connection loop to make these faults reachable — a hostile client
over a real socket was sufficient. That is evidence toward the **keep/patch**
arm rather than the own-it arm, and it is one input rather than the verdict;
§2c's criterion also asks whether the deadline patch stays contained, which is
WP46's to answer.

**One defect in the lab itself, recorded because it is the same defect:** the
first version hung, because `net.recv_tcp` blocks and a patience loop around a
blocking read never re-evaluates its own deadline. **The lab reproduced, in its
own client, exactly the unbounded-wait bug it exists to find in the server.** A
timeout set on only one side of a connection is a timeout somebody is relying on
the other side to have.

**TESTS.** This is **P-T5**, deferred here by name from the Phase-3 plan.
Seeded and reproducible: fragmentation, slow reader/writer, timeout before and
after completion, concurrent close, failure after N bytes, slot reuse, an
artificially small pool, shutdown during a request. **Added at E-4:** a
registration-conflict poisoning (WP30) is now a trippable boot failure, so the
menu covers boot-time refusals and not only dispatch-time ones. Success criterion, stated
before it is built: **replay the same seed and get the same trail, and find at
least one mutation the current tests miss** — a lab that cannot demonstrate a
missed mutation has not earned its complexity. **Rollback: HIGH** (tests only).

### WP42 — Concurrency model (ADR-030)

**DONE, 2026-07-21 — `planning/phase-4-concurrency.md`,
`experiments/12-concurrency-arms/`, ADR-030 ACCEPTED. Decision:
SINGLE-THREADED**, with the burden of proof left on threading and the reopening
conditions written down.

**The timing did not decide and the pre-registered rule said what to do about
that.** Threaded finished ~31% sooner (1,288 ms vs 1,861 ms, both 400/400), and
31% sits far inside FINDING-A's 138% noise floor. Inconclusive means
single-threaded — a rule fixed before the prototype ran, precisely because at
this moment the temptation is to read a wide noise band as a mild preference.

**What decided it was correctness.** `thread_count > 1` is a ONE-LINE change in
the adapter, and it silently falsifies three shipped guarantees: the
non-atomic request-ID counter (whose own comment says so), the lazily-built miss
chain (a check-then-act into an append-only pool — a WRONG CHAIN, not a wrong
label), and the shared `dispatched`/`web.state` writes. Four amendments to
shipped guarantees in exchange for a speed-up this machine cannot measure.

**Recorded honestly: a collision was NOT observed**, and an apparent finding —
141 of 300 empty responses under threading — **evaporated against its control**,
which produced 133 of 300 single-threaded. The empties were the probe's own
shell redirection. That control is the only reason it did not ship as a defect.

**PROTOTYPE + ADR.** See §2b — the procedure is the deliverable, plus the
decision it produces. Resolves the direction of audit A-4 (package-level
transport globals) jointly with WP43. **Rollback: decays fast** — this is why
it precedes every package it shapes.

### WP43 — Per-server state replaces the transport globals

**DONE, 2026-07-21 — `web/internal/transport/odin_http_adapter.odin`,
`build/check_public_api.sh` §8d.** Internal only, **zero public change**, and
**every existing test passed unchanged and unmodified**, which was the
package's own condition.

**The defect it removes has the worst possible shape.** `web.serve` wrote its
`Config` into a package global that the backend handler read on every request.
With one server per process that is fine. With two it is a **silent
cross-wire**: the second `serve` overwrites the first's dispatch pointer, and
requests to one application run the other's — with nothing diagnosing it,
because from each server's own point of view nothing is wrong.

**No vendored change was needed.** The backend's `Handler` already carries a
`user_data: rawptr`; the capability was there and unused. The config now travels
WITH the handler, in a `Server_Runtime` that lives in `serve`'s own frame — no
allocation, no teardown, and no slot for a second server to overwrite.

**`g_server` deliberately remains, and is now the ONE NAMED exception** in the
gate rather than an unremarked survivor. `request_stop` asks a process-wide
question that only WP44's public surface can answer properly; removing it here
would mean inventing half of WP44 inside an internal package. Naming it is what
stops a second such global arriving quietly — proven by a negative control.

**IMPLEMENTATION, internal only.** ADR-018's direction; the prerequisite for
two servers in one process, for embedded use, and for WP44 having something
coherent to stop. Existing tests pass unchanged and unmodified. **Rollback:
HIGH while internal — defend that classification exactly as WP29 does.**

### WP44 — Lifecycle: stop, shutdown with a deadline, exactly-once cleanup

**SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION, public surface.** The smallest surface that gives:
admission stop first, an **absolute** deadline (never "wait forever"), and
cleanup proven exactly-once by the WP41 lab. G-09 evidence per symbol at spec
time. **Rollback: LOW once shipped** — operators build scripts and systemd
units on a stop command within days; size it like WP36 sized its options
struct, because every symbol is a promise.

### WP45 — Connection lifetime: keep-alive, drain-or-close, staged close

**IMPLEMENTATION.** C-3 binds it three times over: 400-and-close on framing
errors, drain-or-close after every early rejection (§9.3 — leftover bytes are
the next request smuggled), and the staged close of §9.6, because a 400 the
client never receives is a real failure mode. Extends the WP9 corpus with
connection-lifetime assertions. **Rollback: MEDIUM** — observable wire
behaviour, but behind spec-recorded RFC obligations rather than taste.

### WP46 — Limits: connections, queue depth, headers, minimum ingress rate

**SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION. Amended 2026-07-20 by ADR-031: this package now also
carries READ AND WRITE DEADLINES**, the half WP36 could not ship. They are rows
in the same `Limits` value, derived and validated at boot exactly like the byte
budgets, and they are the reason WP51 now precedes this package — enforcing them
requires patching the vendored connection read, and the primitive to do it
(`core:nbio`'s `timeout` and `close`) is already used by that server.

The deadline fields are **named at spec time, against WP41's fault menu rather
than against a wish list**, and sized by WP36's rule: every field is a promise
kept for as long as the type exists. A deadline is proven by a **seeded slow
client in the WP41 lab**, never by a unit test, and enters the claim ledger with
an unbounded-read negative control.

New rows in WP36's boot-derived runtime — the same
validate-once pattern, never a second mechanism. The slowloris mitigation is a
minimum ingress rate **on top of the deadline, not instead of it**: a deadline
bounds one connection's total patience, an ingress rate bounds the trickle that
stays inside it; OWASP names the technique and no numbers, so the chosen
numbers are recorded **as judgement, not as citation** (the C-5 honesty rule),
in the capacity ledger with behaviour-when-full. **Rollback: MEDIUM** — a
default, once shipped, is a promise about traffic.

### WP47 — Deterministic load shedding

**IMPLEMENTATION.** Bounded admission per WP40's reservation rows. The claim
"rejection is cheaper than admitted work" enters the claim ledger **with a
measurement and a negative control**. **Rollback: MEDIUM.**

### WP48 — Trusted proxies

**SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION** under ADR-013's accepted direction. IPv4/IPv6 CIDR
corpus; direct-spoof negative controls; both peer and effective addresses kept
internally; `Forwarded` never echoed. **Rollback: LOW once anyone's audit or
rate-limit policy depends on it — which is exactly why the ADR preceded the
implementation.**

### WP49 — Secure headers and cookies

**SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION.** Forces the `Recorded_Response` header decision that
Phase 2 deferred (D-14.3) — resolve it in the spec half, not in passing.
**Rollback: MEDIUM.**

### WP50 — Observability, with redaction as its spec half

**SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION.** The redaction policy lands first: OWASP's
do-not-log list made concrete (tokens, session identifiers, passwords,
connection strings, keys, PII, payment data), CR/LF escaping against log
injection, and the standing rule that metrics and spans key on the **route
pattern from WP34's accessor, never the raw path**. Non-blocking, with an
observable drop policy — a logger that can apply backpressure to requests has
inverted the hierarchy. **Rollback: MEDIUM.**

### WP51 — Vendor maintenance policy

**SPEC. MOVED BEFORE WP46 (§2c), because ADR-031 makes WP46 a patching
package** and a patch that predates the policy governing patches is how a fork
starts. This package's output is therefore a precondition, not a retrospective.

Audit A-9/A-10: upstream the security patches or record why not;
replace code-shape greps over vendored sources with corpus assertions (a
correct re-application of a patch, written differently, must still pass);
name who watches upstream and how often. **Rollback: HIGH.**

### WP52 — Fuzzing and the extended framing corpus

**TESTS.** Extends WP9's raw-wire corpus to response framing and the C-3
cases. Body policy (HEAD, 1xx, 204, 304) stays internally separate from
framing (fixed length, chunked, close-delimited) so the combinations remain
enumerable — neither concept becomes public API. **Rollback: HIGH.**

### WP53 — Load, soak and fault-injection tests

**TESTS.** Includes a slow-client and a slow-writer workload. Methodology
inherits WP26 wholesale: two instruments, status distribution reported,
hardware-keyed baselines, distributions never single figures. **Rollback:
HIGH.**

### WP54 — Allocator and lifetime audit, whole-system

**TESTS.** Tracking allocator over the full serve path; baseline is WP35's
shipped policy. Generational tokens for slots and timers **only if reuse
exists by now** — P-T7's discipline restated: the abstraction arrives with the
reuse, never before.

**Resolved at E-4:** WP35 decided to change nothing and **no slot reuse
exists**, so the contingency is OUT of scope as this plan stands. It returns
only if a Phase-4 package introduces reuse — and ADR-031's per-connection timers
are the one candidate, so WP46 owns the finding if it creates any. **Rollback:
HIGH.**

### WP55 — Operations documentation

**DOCS.** How to deploy — reverse-proxy TLS termination as the documented
topology (§2b) — what to bound, what to monitor, what is **not** hardened, and
the supervisor expectation stated for operators (ADR-020: a faulting handler
aborts the process; that is the contract, not a bug). Points at `uruquim
doctor` on the product track. **Rollback: HIGH.**

### WP56 — Phase-4 freeze

**FREEZE.** Everything WP38 required, plus: a capacity-ledger row for every
WP40 resource; the fault-lab seeds recorded as data; a claim-ledger row with a
negative control for every shed/stop/drain promise; soak results recorded; the
usage lab re-run — the concept budget conversation does not end at Phase 3.
Approval delegated to the gate exactly as WP38's was.

## 3b. What "no deficiencies" means here, and what it does not

The owner's instruction for this phase is a framework **without deficiencies**,
accepting hard architecture to get there. That is a real constraint and it
needs a definition, or it becomes a licence to build everything.

**A deficiency is a gap between what the framework CLAIMS and what it DOES.**
That is the standard this phase is held to, and by it the current tree has
exactly three:

1. **No deadline of any kind.** The capacity ledger says Uruquim bounds its own
   per-request working memory; it bounds the *bytes* and not the *time*, and a
   slow client walks through the byte budget untouched. → ADR-031, WP46.
2. **No way to stop.** `web.serve` blocks until the process ends, so the only
   shutdown is a kill, and in-flight requests are cut. → WP39, WP44.
3. **No bound on connections, accept queue or header count.** The ledger says
   so plainly today, which makes it honest rather than a lie — but honest about
   a hole is still a hole. → WP40, WP46, WP47.

**An absence is NOT a deficiency when it is stated, reasoned, and belongs to
someone else.** In-process TLS, CORS, uploads, static files, WebSocket and
streaming are absent by decision, with the reasoning recorded and the surface
assigned to optional packages or to the deployment. Building them into the core
would not remove a deficiency; it would add attack surface to a framework whose
value proposition is a small, frozen, gate-enforced one — and the mission's
precedence puts discipline above convenience for exactly this case.

**The one place the distinction is uncomfortable, stated rather than hidden:**
panic aborts the process (ADR-020). That is not a deficiency — Odin has no
recoverable panic, so it is a property of the language, and the framework's
duty is to say so and to make the supervisor expectation explicit (WP55). A
framework that pretended otherwise would have a deficiency; this one has a
constraint it documents.

**The test for the phase, then:** at WP56, every row of the capacity ledger
states a bound and a behaviour-when-full, every claim in the claim ledger has a
negative control, and no document describes a limit the framework does not
enforce. That is "no deficiencies" made checkable, which is the only form of it
worth promising.

## 4. Deliberately not in this phase

* **CORS, uploads, static files** — out of core by §2b; their recorded
  constraints travel with the future optional packages.
* **In-process TLS** — §2b; the ops doc documents proxy termination instead.
* **Adaptive overload control** — only after WP47's deterministic shedding has
  shipped and been measured (research items 10 → 11, in that order).
* **HTTP/2, WebSocket, streaming** — Phase-5 backlog, spec-gated, may be
  declined.
* **Rewriting the HTTP server** — R-T3, rejected and staying rejected **as a
  rewrite**. ADR-033 asks a narrower question with evidence attached: whether
  Uruquim eventually owns the HTTP/1.1 connection layer over `core:nbio` as a
  SECOND ADAPTER behind the ADR-009 boundary, gated on the conformance matrix.
  That is not a rewrite and not a big-bang replacement, and it is decided at
  WP41 or not at all.
* **Anything Phase 5 wants early.** A Phase-4 package that finds it needs one
  writes the finding down; it does not absorb the scope.

## 5. Risks this plan does not resolve

| Risk | Why it stays open |
|---|---|
| **The concurrency decision invalidates WP44–47 details** | That is why WP42 precedes them and why E-4 forces the refresh; the §3 prose is deliberately contract-level until then. |
| **The fault menu is finite** | A real network invents faults nobody seeded. WP53's soak is the partial answer; humility in the freeze wording is the rest. |
| **Slowloris numbers are judgement** | OWASP gives none. The ledger records them as engineering judgement, revisable with operational evidence — never as citation. |
| **Timing claims inherit FINDING-A** | Unless the toolchain changed and was re-verified (§0), every timing claim in this phase is a distribution or it is not made. |
| **The stop surface is LOW-reversibility** | WP44 ships the smallest surface for exactly this reason, and the spec half exists to be argued with before anything is promised. |

## 6. The Tina dossier — Phase-4 mapping

The rules of the Phase-3 plan's §6 apply unchanged and are not repeated in
full: **reference, never architecture; never a dependency; never committed;
never cited as evidence; its absence never blocks.** Phase 4 is where the
dossier is at its most useful — a runtime that supervises faults for a living
has answered these questions explicitly — and at its most dangerous, because
its answers are sized for a runtime Uruquim is not.

| Work package | Read | What is in there |
|---|---|---|
| **WP39, WP44** | `docs/03-io-scheduler-e-lifecycle.md` | Lifecycle states, cancellation, completion ordering |
| **WP40, WP46, WP47** | `docs/02-memoria-ownership-e-backpressure.md` | Backpressure, bounded pools, behaviour-when-full discipline |
| **WP41** | `docs/04-supervisao-falhas-e-dst.md` | Deterministic fault testing — this is P-T5's home |
| **WP42** | `docs/01-arquitetura-do-runtime.md` | The thread-per-core design — **first entry on the not-adopt list; read to understand, not to copy** |
| **WP52** | `docs/05-tina-http.md` | A second HTTP implementation's framing decisions |
| **WP54** | `docs/02-…` P-T7 | Generational tokens, arriving only with reuse |
| **WP56** | `docs/09-…` P-T1/P-T2, `docs/10-…` | Claim discipline and self-bounding, as in every freeze |

Not adopted, restated from the dossier's own impact document: thread-per-core
as a requirement, isolate-per-connection in the API, global arenas, signal
recovery, a messaging protocol, the Tina backend in core.

## 7. What an implementation agent should read first

1. **§0 and E-4 of this document.** If the refresh has not been applied, the
   first work package is the refresh.
2. `planning/later-phases-plan.md` §Phase 4 — C-1…C-8 and the RG-P4 gates
   remain authoritative for the questions they cover.
3. `planning/phase-3-plan.md` §2b and **ADR-029** — how approvals work now;
   the reserved matters that still stop for the owner.
4. `planning/phase-2-freeze.md`, and the Phase-3 freeze once it exists — the
   ledgers this phase amends and the claims it must not break.
5. `planning/adrs.md` — an ACCEPTED ADR supersedes plan text when they
   disagree; ADR-013 and ADR-020 bind this phase directly.
6. `tina/` — the mapped document only (§6), when the environment supplies it.
7. **The code and tests of the work package before it** — this project has had
   documented behaviour the code did not have; never conclude from documents
   alone.
