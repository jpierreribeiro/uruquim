# Phases 3 to 5 — work packages and research gates

**Status: DRAFT. Nothing here is frozen. No future signature is committed.**

Detail is deliberately **proportional to distance**. Phase 3 has defined work
packages with its representation decisions explicitly conditioned on
measurement. Phase 4 has capabilities and gates without invented APIs. Phase 5
is a prioritised backlog, not a product promise. Producing precise signatures
for work two years out would be false precision, and this document does not do
it.

evidence), [`odin-fit-audit.md`](odin-fit-audit.md) (design fit),

## Findings from external research that constrain these phases

Recorded here because each one removes a choice or forces one. Sources in §5.

### C-1 — HEAD is effectively mandatory, and 501 is a SHOULD Uruquim currently declines

RFC 9110 §9.1: *"All general-purpose servers MUST support the methods GET and
HEAD. All other methods are OPTIONAL."* Uruquim registers GET, POST, PUT, PATCH
and DELETE only, and WP9 deliberately disabled the backend's HEAD→GET behaviour.

The same section splits the error cases: a method *unrecognized or not
implemented* SHOULD get **501**; a method *recognized but not allowed for this
resource* SHOULD get **405**. Uruquim collapses unknown methods into the 404/405
path, which WP9 ratified deliberately (D7: the transport must not invent a
status before the core sees the request).

Both are **SHOULD**, not MUST, so deviating is permitted — but it must be a
recorded decision rather than an omission. Phase 3 owns HEAD and OPTIONS; the
501 question should be decided at the same time, in the same ADR.

Cheap conformant HEAD: route to the GET handler and suppress the body. §9.3.2
explicitly permits omitting header fields "for which a value is determined only
while generating the content", so `Content-Length` need not be computed.

### C-2 — observability is blocked on one missing accessor, and the constraint is a MUST

The OpenTelemetry HTTP semantic conventions define `http.route` as *"the matched
route template … **MUST be low-cardinality** and include all static path
segments, with dynamic path segments represented with placeholders"*, and — the
load-bearing sentence — *"**MUST NOT be populated when this is not supported by
the HTTP server framework** … the URI path can NOT substitute it."* Span naming
adds: *"Instrumentation **MUST NOT** default to using URI path as a target."*

So today any conformant instrumentation is **required to omit** `http.route`
entirely and forbidden from falling back to the path. That means no per-route
latency metrics and degraded span names.

Uruquim already *has* the template — the App-owned `pattern` string, matched in
`web/dispatch_match.odin` — it simply never surfaces it. **Exposing the matched
pattern as a borrowed string is the single smallest change that unlocks the
entire observability story, and it costs nothing**: the pattern is already
App-owned and already viewed by `Route_Param.name`. This is a Phase-3/4 decision
worth making early.

Related: when the method is not recognised, the conventions expect
`http.request.method_original` to carry the raw token. Uruquim exposes no
`method_raw` publicly, so that attribute is unavailable to any future
instrumentation. Worth recording, not worth fixing before there is a consumer.

### C-3 — framing errors are response-**and-close**, not just response

RFC 9112 §6.3 states the close obligation three separate times: a
`Transfer-Encoding` that is not finally-chunked in a request → *"MUST respond
with 400 … and then close the connection"*; an invalid `Content-Length` → *"MUST
treat it as an unrecoverable error … respond with 400 … and then close"*; a
short read against a valid `Content-Length` → *"MUST consider the message
incomplete and close"*. §9.3 adds the rule that bites on early rejection: *"A
server MUST read the entire request message body or close the connection after
sending its response"* — otherwise leftover bytes are parsed as the next
request.

This is a **transport-layer contract**, and it interacts with Uruquim's
single-commit response guard: a 413 or 400 committed by the core must still
result in drain-or-close at the transport. WP9's corpus covers the rejection;
Phase 4 owns the connection-lifetime half. §9.6 also warns that closing without
a staged half-close can reset the client's buffers before it reads the 400 — so
the error the client never sees is a real failure mode.

### C-4 — no header-derived client identity is trustworthy

RFC 7239 §8.1: *"The 'Forwarded' HTTP header field cannot be relied upon to be
correct, as it may be modified … by every node on the way to the server,
including the client making the request."* And on the standard mitigation:
allowlisting trusted proxies *"has at least two weaknesses. First, the chain of
IP addresses listed before the request came to the proxy cannot be trusted."*

There is therefore **no spec-blessed way to derive a trustworthy client IP from
headers alone**. The only defensible design is: default to the peer address, and
require the number of trusted hops (or a trusted-proxy set) to be explicit
operator configuration. Anything that silently reads `X-Forwarded-For` ships a
spoofable identity. §8.2 adds that `Forwarded` must never be copied into a
response, since it reveals the proxy chain.

### C-5 — the radix-router justification is not what folklore says

Neither httprouter nor matchit — the two canonical implementations — states when
a radix tree is *not* worth it, and **neither compares against a linear scan at
small route counts**. Their documented wins are: allocation-free matching,
exactly-one-match semantics, and scaling to many or long routes. The first two
are achievable with a linear scan over pre-split segments as well. Only the
third is uniquely the tree's, and no author quantifies where it starts to matter.

Counter-datapoint from a standard library: Go 1.22's `ServeMux` deliberately did
**not** use a radix tree, choosing a backtracking decision tree instead, and it
resolves ambiguity by **panicking at registration** on conflicting patterns.

**Consequence for Phase 3: justify a router change by match semantics or by
Uruquim's own measurements — never by unsourced performance folklore.** Any
"linear scan is fine below N routes" claim in this project is engineering
judgement and must be labelled as such.

### C-6 — request-scoped state: both mainstream mechanisms are solving a problem Uruquim does not have

Go's `context.WithValue` costs one heap allocation per value plus a full
`Request` copy per middleware, with O(depth) lookup. Rust's `http::Extensions`
is a boxed `HashMap<TypeId, Box<dyn Any>>`. Both exist for type-erased,
dynamically-keyed state crossing library boundaries — which Uruquim does not
need. Struct fields in a request arena, which is what `Context_Internal` already
is, dominate both. If extensibility is ever genuinely required, a small fixed
`[N]{key, rawptr}` array in the arena beats both. This supports G-03 rather than
challenging it.

### C-7 — post-`next` middleware costs a frame per hop in every language that offers it

koa-compose allocates a closure and a promise per middleware per request. Axum's
ergonomic `from_fn` boxes "the rest of the chain" per call, even though Tower's
type-level `Layer` composition is in principle zero-cost. Go's `net/http` has no
middleware type at all and gets post-`next` free on the machine stack.

Uruquim's forced design (Phase 2, FINDING-B) — a cursor plus ordinary calls —
lands closest to Go's: post-`next` costs stack frames, not allocations. That is
a genuine advantage and Phase 3's chain work must not surrender it.

### C-8 — Odin will never have a package manager, and no library tags releases

The FAQ is explicit: *"Odin will **never** officially support a package
manager"*, and recommends *"copying and vendoring each package manually, and
fixing the specific versions down"*. A survey of the ecosystem found almost no
library tags releases at all; the best-run precedent (`DanielGavin/ols`) tags
against **the Odin release it builds for** (`dev-2026-05`, …). Odin itself ships
monthly `dev-YYYY-MM` releases, has no semver and no 1.0, and lands breaking
core-library changes in ordinary monthly releases — `core:os` was replaced
wholesale in `dev-2026-03`, with the old API retained only "until sometime in Q3
of 2026", which is approximately now.

**Uruquim is already ahead of the ecosystem here**: `odin-version.txt` pins a
release, a commit and an asset SHA-256, which is stronger than anything
surveyed. Keep it, state it in the README, and put **no** package-manager
integration on the roadmap. Budget one to two core-library migrations per year.

---

## Phase 3 — Performance core

**Entry:** Phase 2 frozen; a benchmark harness exists.
**Theme:** make it stay fast as route count and traffic grow, and let operators
bound it. Representation decisions are conditioned on measurement.

### Research gates (must complete before the implementation work packages)

| # | Gate | Question | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| RG-1 | Benchmark harness | What is the methodology? Recorded hardware, warm-up, route distribution, concurrency levels, p50/p95/p99, allocations, binary size, build time, peak and retained memory. **Plus semantic equivalence — see below** | a harness in the gate, plus a recorded Phase-1 baseline to regress against |
| RG-2 | Router shootout | Pointer-based radix, index-based radix, hybrid, improved linear, **and class-bucketed linear** — measured on Uruquim's own workloads at 5, 50, 500 **and 5,000** routes | a representation chosen from data, with **the losing candidates and their numbers recorded** |
| RG-3 | Allocation audit | Where does per-request allocation actually go? Includes audit A-8 (inbound headers built and never read), A-12 (static headers cloned) and A-13 (the `Header_Pair` ↔ `transport.Header` conversions) | a measured list, and a decision per item |
| RG-4 | Arena policy | What happens to a request arena after an unusually large body? Retain, trim or release (risk R-16) | a policy with numbers behind it |

#### RG-1 amendment (2026-07-20) — a benchmark must compare the same thing

Add to the methodology, as a gate condition rather than advice: **every
candidate must answer the same protocol version, and produce equivalent
status, headers and body.** Record the protocol, keep-alive setting, warm-up,
alternating order, core affinity and build mode alongside the numbers.

This is not pedantry, it is a measured failure. A reference study attempted an
ApacheBench comparison and had to throw the whole run away: `ab` speaks
HTTP/1.0, the strict HTTP/1.1 server rejected it, and the tool cheerfully
reported 100% non-2xx as *throughput*. **A load generator that gets rejected
still reports a number.** A benchmark whose candidates disagree about the
protocol measures error rate and calls it performance — and the number will be
believed, because it looks like a number.

#### RG-2 amendment (2026-07-20) — a fifth candidate, and a warning that survives it

Add **class-bucketed linear**: routes split into static / `:param` /
`*wildcard` buckets at registration, with a linear scan inside the matching
bucket. It is worth measuring for a reason that has nothing to do with speed —
it makes the precedence rule between the three classes structural instead of
being re-derived by comparison order.

The candidate arrives with its own disclaimer, and C-5 governs it exactly as it
governs the others: **the bucketed design also scans linearly inside each
bucket.** It is a hypothesis to measure, not a result to adopt. "A real,
validated system does it this way" is not evidence about Uruquim's route
cardinalities, and this project chooses representations from its own numbers.

Extend the cardinality sweep to 5,000 routes if the harness cost allows: the
only property a tree uniquely owns is scaling, so the sweep must reach far
enough for scaling to be visible or the shootout cannot answer the question it
exists to answer.

### Work packages

| WP | Name | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| P3-1 | Benchmark harness and Phase-1 baseline | TESTS | RG-1; nothing else may start first |
| P3-2 | Route representation shootout | PROTOTYPE | RG-2; **must not choose before measuring** (C-5) |
| P3-3 | Router implementation | IMPLEMENTATION | observable behaviour must stay byte-identical to Phase 1 for every existing test |
| P3-4 | Registration conflict diagnostics | IMPLEMENTATION | Phase 1 deliberately does not diagnose; Go panics at registration — decide and record |
| P3-5 | Path normalisation policy | SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION | Phase 1 normalises nothing on purpose; this is where a policy is chosen or the absence is ratified permanently |
| P3-6 | HEAD and OPTIONS, and the 501 decision | SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION | C-1; HEAD is effectively mandatory |
| P3-7 | Multi-param routes without a map | IMPLEMENTATION | small fixed inline array of views — the convergent design in every implementation surveyed (C-6) |
| P3-8 | Precomputed middleware chains | IMPLEMENTATION | must preserve Phase 2's zero-allocation dispatch (C-7) |
| P3-9 | Route identity accessor | SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION | C-2; the smallest change that unblocks observability. **Adds public surface — owner approval** |
| P3-10 | Arena, buffer reuse and oversize policy | IMPLEMENTATION | RG-4, risk R-16 |
| P3-11 | Configurable limits and timeouts | SPEC + IMPLEMENTATION | options struct with a package default constant, on `core:net`'s `DEFAULT_TCP_OPTIONS` precedent — **not** a builder. **Derive an immutable runtime at boot, see below.** **Owner approval** |
| P3-12 | Typed application state | PROTOTYPE + IMPLEMENTATION | ADR-004; must not become a context extension bag (G-03). **Owner approval** |
| P3-13 | Phase-3 freeze | FREEZE | ledger, evidence, regression benchmark in the gate |

### P3-8 / P3-11 amendment (2026-07-20) — validate once at boot, read on the hot path

Two work packages share one shape, and naming it once keeps them consistent.

**The pattern.** Configuration the user writes is friendly, permissive and
validated *once*, at `serve`, producing a private immutable structure the
request path only ever READS. Nothing on the hot path re-interprets a limit,
re-derives a relationship between two limits, or discovers at request time that
a configuration was contradictory.

**P3-11 — a derived `Server_Runtime`.** The user-facing options struct stays
small and pleasant. From it, `serve` derives a private, validated value holding
the resolved budgets — request line, header block, body, response bytes,
timeouts, arena policy — with every cross-limit relationship checked once and
diagnosed at boot rather than at 3 a.m. under load. Keep it the smallest struct
HTTP actually needs; do **not** import a general system-specification concept
from a runtime that sizes shards, pools and rings, because Uruquim sizes none of
those.

**P3-8 — a route/chain snapshot.** Compile the final table and the flattened
chains before serving begins; dispatch reads offsets and counts only.
Registration *during* serving is then either rejected or made impossible,
depending on the concurrency decision — and that choice must be recorded, not
left to whichever happens to be true.

**Why it belongs to Phase 3 and not earlier.** Boot-time derivation is only
worth its complexity once limits are configurable at all, which is P3-11
itself. Doing it in Phase 2, where every limit is a fixed constant, would add
a layer with nothing to validate.

### Change classification, to be applied per work package

Phase 3 must state, for every change, which of these it is — the categories are
not interchangeable and the gate obligations differ:

* **internal only** — no observable difference; existing tests must pass
  unchanged and unmodified;
* **observable behaviour change** — needs a spec amendment and new tests;
* **public API change** — needs a ledger entry, G-09 evidence and owner
  approval;
* **Advanced API** — kept out of the common surface entirely.

---

## Phase 4 — Production

**Entry:** Phase 3 frozen; limits and timeouts exist.
**Theme:** make deployment defensible. This phase carries the most absolute
risk, because its mistakes are remotely exploitable rather than merely
inconvenient.

### Research gates (added 2026-07-20; must complete before the capabilities they govern)

Phase 4 already lists the right capabilities. What it lacked was a *method* for
proving them, and the reference study is most useful here, because a runtime that
supervises faults for a living has to answer these questions explicitly rather
than by hoping. These three gates produce the methodology; they add no public
surface and no capability of their own.

| # | Gate | Question | Output | Governs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RG-P4-A | Lifecycle state machine | What are the legal states and transitions, written as data rather than as a set of booleans? | `Configuring → Serving → Draining → Stopped`, plus `→ Failed`; proof of admission stop, close-after-send, an absolute deadline, and cleanup running exactly once | P4-2, P4-3, P4-4 |
| RG-P4-B | Capacity and overload | For every bounded resource, what happens when it is full? | one row per resource — connections, accept queue, ingress, response buffers, timers — each stating capacity, behaviour when full, the diagnostic, who owns cleanup, and **the minimum reserved for stop/close** | P4-5, P4-6 |
| RG-P4-C | Deterministic fault plan | Can a transport failure be reproduced from a seed instead of from luck? | a seeded transport laboratory: fragmentation, slow reader/writer, timeout before and after completion, concurrent close, failure after N bytes, slot reuse, artificially small pool. Final checker: no retained buffer, no double response, no request admitted after the admission stop | P4-16, P4-17, P4-18 |

Three notes on why these are gates and not just tests.

**RG-P4-A — a state machine, not flags.** The failure mode this prevents is the
one every server eventually has: `stopping`, `draining` and `failed` as separate
booleans, admitting combinations that were never intended and that no reviewer
can enumerate. A small enum makes the impossible states unrepresentable, which
is the same reasoning that already gave Uruquim a closed `Framework_Error`
instead of an `any`.

**RG-P4-B — the reservation is the point.** The subtle failure is not running
out of capacity; it is running out of capacity *and then having none left to
shut down cleanly*. A server that cannot close connections because closing
needs a slot it already gave to a request will not recover under exactly the
load where recovery matters. Reserve the control path first, then serve.

**RG-P4-C — reproducibility is the deliverable.** The success criterion is
explicit and testable: replay the same seed and get the same trail, and find at
least one mutation the current tests do not catch. A fault laboratory that
cannot demonstrate a missed mutation has not yet earned its complexity.

**Generational tokens** become relevant only once RG-P4-A and RG-P4-B introduce
slot reuse. When a connection slot or timer is recycled, every timeout and
completion must carry `{slot, generation}` and be discarded if the generation no
longer matches — otherwise a stale timeout from request A closes request B on
the reused slot. Do not build the abstraction before the reuse exists.

**Body policy is separate from framing.** HEAD, 1xx, 204 and 304 decide whether
a body exists; fixed length, chunked and close-delimited decide how it is
framed. Keeping them separate internally is what makes the combinations
enumerable and the raw-wire corpus extensible to responses. Neither concept
needs to become public API.

### Capabilities and their gates

| WP | Capability | Notes and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| P4-1 | Concurrency model and thread safety | must resolve audit A-4 (package-level transport globals) and A-14 (registration during dispatch). Today `serve` is single-threaded by construction; whether that changes is *the* Phase-4 architectural decision |
| P4-2 | Lifecycle: stop, shutdown with an absolute deadline, admission stop, exactly-once cleanup | audit A-5; there is no stop today. **Adds public surface — owner approval** |
| P4-3 | Per-server state replacing the globals | ADR-018; prerequisite for two servers or any embedded use |
| P4-4 | Connection lifetime: keep-alive, drain-or-close, staged close | C-3; the close obligation appears three times in RFC 9112 §6.3, and §9.6's staged close is what makes the client actually receive the 400 |
| P4-5 | Limits: connections, queue depth, header count and size, request line, minimum ingress rate | the slowloris mitigation is a minimum ingress rate; OWASP names it and gives no numbers, so Uruquim must pick and justify its own |
| P4-6 | Deterministic load shedding | bounded admission before any adaptive controller (research item 11 stays after this) |
| P4-7 | Trusted proxies and peer preservation | C-4; ADR-013 must be accepted first. Default to the peer address; trusted hops are explicit operator configuration; never echo `Forwarded` into a response |
| P4-8 | CORS | C-5 in §5: five headers, with `*` **not** sufficient under credentials and **not** covering `Authorization`; preflight restricted to an ok status; `Vary: Origin` required for dynamic origins. Candidate for an optional package |
| P4-9 | Secure headers, cookies | cookies force the `Recorded_Response` header decision (Phase-2 D-14.3) |
| P4-10 | Multipart and uploads | OWASP: allow-list extensions, validate after decoding the filename, generate the stored name, never trust `Content-Type`, size limits, storage outside the webroot, no execute permission. **Recommended as a separate package** |
| P4-11 | Static files | traversal, symlinks, ranges, cache validators — a security surface of its own. **Recommended as a separate package** |
| P4-12 | Observability, non-blocking | C-2; **must** key on the low-cardinality route pattern, never the raw path |
| P4-13 | Redaction policy | OWASP's do-not-log list is concrete: tokens, session identifiers, passwords, connection strings, keys, PII, payment data — plus CR/LF escaping against log injection. Phase 1's "nothing reaches a log line" property must be preserved deliberately, not by accident |
| P4-14 | TLS decision | **do not assume the framework terminates TLS.** Compare in-process termination, reverse-proxy termination (the common deployment, and free) and an optional adapter. Recommendation: document proxy termination as supported; in-process at most an optional package. **Owner approval** |
| P4-15 | Vendor maintenance policy | audit A-9/A-10: upstream the five security patches or record why not; replace code-shape greps with corpus assertions; define who watches upstream and how often |
| P4-16 | Fuzzing and an extended framing corpus | extends WP9's raw-wire corpus |
| P4-17 | Load, soak and fault-injection tests | must include a slow-client and a slow-writer workload |
| P4-18 | Allocator and lifetime audit | whole-system, with a tracking allocator |
| P4-19 | Operations documentation | how to deploy, what to bound, what to monitor, what is not hardened |
| P4-20 | Phase-4 freeze | FREEZE |

---

## Phase 5 — Ecosystem backlog

**Not a product promise.** Each item is spec-gated individually, may be
declined, and requires a real user request before it starts. Classification per
the Odin-fit audit.

| Item | Classification | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| `core:net/http` adapter | **NEEDS_PROTOTYPE, unscheduled** | **The package does not exist** — verified absent from both the pinned toolchain and the current official index. `core/net` is sockets, DNS and URL parsing; `core/nbio` is an event loop. Treat as a hypothesis with no date |
| OpenAPI generation | SHOULD_BE_OPTIONAL_PACKAGE | a layer over route information; never a generator requirement |
| Automatic documentation | SHOULD_BE_OPTIONAL_PACKAGE | follows OpenAPI |
| Validation | NEEDS_PROTOTYPE | tag-based validation edges toward the type-system cleverness Odin's own principles avoid; explicit validation may simply be the answer |
| WebSocket | SHOULD_BE_OPTIONAL_PACKAGE | its own protocol surface (RFC 6455) |
| Streaming request/response | SHOULD_BE_OPTIONAL_PACKAGE | changes the body-ownership model that ADR-006 and ADR-012 rest on |
| HTTP/2 | SHOULD_BE_OPTIONAL_PACKAGE | only as the transport permits; RFC 9113 is a large surface |
| Advanced API (`app_init`, `Advanced_Config`, `serve_transport`) | ACCEPTABLE_WITH_GUARDRAILS | ADR-010, still PROPOSED; must stay out of the common surface |
| Templates | **REJECT for core** | ecosystem territory |
| Database integration | **REJECT for core** | ecosystem territory; a Postgres *example* belongs in the release track (M4) instead |
| Package distribution and versioning | product track | C-8: vendoring and a pinned toolchain, tagged against the Odin release. **No package-manager integration, ever** |

---

## Product, adoption and maintenance track

Runs alongside the phases (roadmap M0 to M5), not after them.

| Item | When | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `LICENSE` | **now** | the repository is legally unusable without it. **Owner decision** |
| `SECURITY.md` and a reporting channel | M0 | a framework that handles untrusted input needs a disclosure path before external users |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | M0 | must explain the ledger discipline and the gate, or contributors will fight both |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | M0 | |
| Supported Odin version policy | M2 | C-8; state one pinned version as the contract and re-pin deliberately. A CI matrix over the last N monthly releases, with a nightly job allowed to fail, is the early-warning system |
| Platform support, stated honestly | M2 | only Linux x86-64 is tested today. macOS, Windows and other architectures are **untested**, and saying so is the honest position |
| Release checklist and upgrade guide | M3 | |
| Recommended consumption | M2 | vendoring or a submodule; tag against the Odin release, following `ols`'s precedent |
| Beginner documentation, cookbook, full CRUD example, Postgres example | M4 | the cookbook is already a Phase-4 placeholder |
| User study | M5 | `odin-fit-audit.md` §13; **before** any 1.0 stability commitment |
| Retire `planning/`, `experiments/`, knowledge base from the public tree | M5 | per the local cleanup plan's Stage 4 |
| Issue triage and regression policy | M4 | |
| Vendor maintenance policy | P4-15 | |
| `uruquim dev` — watch and rebuild tool | M4 | added 2026-07-20. Separate track, see below |

### `uruquim dev` — a tool, deliberately outside the framework

Watch sources, debounce, run a configurable build/check, restart the child
process, shut the tree down cleanly before killing it, exclude `.git` and
binaries, and keep build logs separate from application logs. A `--check-only`
mode makes it useful to agents as well as to people.

Three constraints make this a track rather than a work package:

- **It must not import `uruquim:web`.** A development tool that links the
  framework starts making decisions for the framework, and every one of them
  would land inside the ledger.
- **It is not on the Phase-2 or Phase-3 critical path.** Productivity is a real
  benefit and not a reason to move work forward; the plan's own rule against
  scope creep applies to pleasant ideas most of all.
- **The reference is Air (the Go tool), not a concurrency runtime.** Hot reload
  is not something such a runtime provides, and the reference study is explicit that this idea
  came from elsewhere. Recording that keeps the study's attribution honest.

A companion `uruquim doctor` — printing the Odin version, the Uruquim commit,
the backend, the effective limits and no secrets — is worth the same track: it
makes a bug report reproducible without a conversation.

### Where the evidence is thin — stated so it is not overclaimed

* **No primary source gives small-route-count guidance for radix routers.**
  Neither httprouter nor matchit addresses it. Any "linear scan is fine below N
  routes" claim in this project is engineering judgement, not citable.
* **"Go's `net/http` has no middleware type"** is absence of evidence; no
  maintainer statement says it is deliberate.
* **RFC 9110's 501 rule is a SHOULD, not a MUST** — Uruquim may deviate, but the
  deviation must be recorded as a decision.
* **OWASP is guidance, not a specification**, and its DoS sheet names techniques
  without numbers. Uruquim must choose and justify its own limits.
* No framework's self-published benchmarks were used as evidence about anything,
  and none should be.
