# Vendor maintenance policy (WP51)

**Status: ACCEPTED 2026-07-21 under the ADR-029 delegation.** Audit items A-9
and A-10.

**This package moved ahead of WP46 deliberately.** ADR-031 makes WP46 the
package that patches the vendored connection read, and **a patch that predates
the policy governing patches is how a fork starts.** So the rules come first,
and WP46 is the first work package held to them.

## 1. What is vendored, and the standing risk

`vendor/odin-http/` is a snapshot of the root server package of
`laytan/odin-http` at commit `112c49b` (2026-04-11), vendored 2026-07-19, MIT.
Twenty-three local patches, all security-, lifecycle- or ownership-motivated, all
marked `URUQUIM PATCH` at their site and all covered by an executable case that
failed before the patch.

**The standing risk is stated by the dependency itself.** Its README:

> *"This is beta software, confirmed to work in my own use cases but can
> certainly contain edge cases and bugs."*
>
> *"I do not hesitate to push API changes at the moment, so beware."*

419 stars, 17 open issues, 8 open pull requests, one principal maintainer
(checked 2026-07-20). That is not a criticism of the project — it is an
accurate description of what a pin against it means, and it is why ADR-033
treats the foundation as an open question rather than a settled dependency.

## 2. Upstream first, and what checking actually found

**Rule: every patch is offered upstream unless there is a recorded reason not
to.** Code we do not own is code we do not maintain, and a patch carried
forever is a fork with extra steps.

**But the plan may never depend on an upstream merge landing.** One maintainer's
queue is not a schedule, and re-vendoring across an API its author says moves is
work regardless of who wrote the fix.

### 2.1 The twenty-three patches, each with its upstream disposition

| # | Patch | Is it upstream's bug? | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Content-Length` must be all ASCII digits; `-1` and `2, 2` rejected | **Yes** — a remote DoS. `strconv.parse_int` accepts `-1`, which then trips a `n >= 0` assertion and **kills the process** | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** See §2.2 — checked, and it appears still present on `main` |
| 2 | A chunk not terminated by CRLF is rejected instead of asserted | **Yes** — a remote DoS, `assert` on malformed input | **APPEARS FIXED UPSTREAM** — see §2.2 |
| 3 | `Content-Length` + `Transfer-Encoding` rejected, not repaired | **No** — a policy difference. RFC 9112 §6.1 permits refusal; upstream chose repair | **CARRY.** Uruquim's WP9 D2 is stricter on purpose |
| 4 | Any repeated `Content-Length` rejected, even if identical | **No** — same class as 3 | **CARRY** |
| 5 | Unknown method becomes `.Unknown` with `method_raw` preserved, no 501 | **No** — a framework-ownership decision (WP9 D7) | **CARRY** |
| 8 | Server-wide bounded admission: a connection past `max_connections - reserved_connections` is closed at accept; the active count is atomic across lanes | **No** — a capacity decision. Upstream is a general server and does not choose a limit; Uruquim does, because a framework that inherits the kernel's limit has a failure mode it did not choose. WP71 proved a lane-local count multiplies the public limit by lane count | **CARRY** |
| 7 | A request with no `Content-Length` reports its body read as SUCCEEDED rather than failed | **Yes** — a plain upstream defect. `_body_ok = false` means "read failed", and the no-body path returned through it without correcting the flag, so `response_must_close` retired the connection | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** It breaks keep-alive for every GET in any application, is one line, and has nothing to do with Uruquim's policies |
| 6 | A configurable request read deadline; a per-thread sweep closes connections whose request has taken too long to arrive | **Yes** — the upstream read has no deadline, and `scanner.odin` carries an unfinished-work comment asking for one at the recv site | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** It is a general slowloris defence, not a Uruquim policy, and the upstream comment is as close to an invitation as one gets |
| 9 | Preserve the `recv_poly` operation handle on the scanner | **Yes** — discarding the handle makes a pending receive structurally uncancellable | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** It is the prerequisite for safe connection teardown, independent of Uruquim policy |
| 10 | Cancel a pending receive before freeing its connection | **Yes** — otherwise completion dereferences freed connection state | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** WP58 reproduced both an endless drain and `free(): invalid pointer` from this lifecycle defect |
| 11 | Bound every drain wait by one absolute deadline | **No** — the deadline and refusal semantics are Uruquim lifecycle policy | **CARRY AS BRIDGE.** Delete when the official adapter replaces this backend |
| 12 | Make multi-lane lifecycle state exact-once or lane-owned: shutdown election, Date cache and refusal total | **Yes** — repeated shutdown walked freed lane state; the shared Date buffer and refusal increment race across lanes | **OFFER UPSTREAM AS BRIDGE.** General multi-threaded server correctness, retained locally only until the adapter transition |
| 13 | Suspend one lane's accept while its synchronous application Handler runs | **No** — upstream optimizes connection acceptance; Uruquim defines Handler capacity and liveness under blocking dependencies | **CARRY AS BRIDGE.** The official adapter must satisfy the liveness corpus, not reproduce this mechanism |
| 14 | A chunked chunk-size must be a non-negative hex value; `-1` and overflow-wrapped sizes are rejected | **Yes** — a remote DoS, the same class as patch 1 in the sibling code path. `strconv.parse_int` accepts `-1` and wraps overflow, and the chunked decoder — unlike the Content-Length path — had no guard, so the negative size tripped `scanner.odin`'s `n >= 0` assertion and **killed the process** | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** Patch 1 fixed only the Content-Length path; the chunked path carries the identical unguarded `parse_int` |
| 15 | A chunked-body trailer field must not abort the frozen header map | **Yes** — a remote DoS on legal HTTP/1.1. The server freezes request headers before dispatch, but a trailer field is parsed after the freeze and mutates the map, tripping `assert(!h.readonly)` and **killing the process** on the first trailer line | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** Trailer parsing is the decoder's own bookkeeping and must clear the freeze that exists to forbid handler mutation, as the terminating-line branch already does |
| 16 | A `Content-Length` with more than 19 significant digits is rejected | **Yes** — a request-smuggling desync. `strconv.parse_int` wraps a value `>= 2^64` to a small positive, so the server reads fewer bytes than declared and treats the remainder as a second request; the `[2^63, 2^64)` range already wrapped negative and was caught, the `>= 2^64` range was not | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** The magnitude check completes the existing negative/non-decimal guard on the same field |
| 17 | A bare carriage return in a header or cookie value is escaped, not passed through | **Yes** — a header-injection vector. `write_escaped_newlines` escaped only the line feed, so a lone `\r` reached the wire and a CR-tolerant downstream parser could treat it as a line terminator | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** The sink already escapes `\n`; escaping `\r` at the same point closes the other half |
| 18 | An obs-fold continuation line beginning with a horizontal tab is rejected, like one beginning with a space | **Yes** — a request-smuggling primitive. RFC 7230 obs-fold is CRLF then a space OR a tab; the original guard caught only the space, so a tab-prefixed line parsed as its own header here while an unfolding proxy merged it, diverging the header set | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** Completes the existing leading-space refusal to both obs-fold forms |
| 19 | The response write deadline: send-path stamps, a write branch in the sweep, cancellation of the outstanding send on every close, and an RST abort as the enforcement (WP90 / ADR-039) | **Mixed** — the missing send cancellation is upstream's use-after-free (Patch 10's twin on the write side); the deadline itself and the RST-not-graceful enforcement are Uruquim policy | **CARRY AS BRIDGE; offer the send-cancel upstream.** Delete with the adapter when `core:net/http` lands; the official adapter must expose an equivalent write deadline before it can replace this one |
| 20 | The idle keep-alive timeout: `idle_since` stamped between requests, cleared on the next request's first bytes, graceful close in the sweep (WP90 / ADR-039) | **No** — upstream simply has no idle policy; keep-alive economy is Uruquim's own operational contract | **CARRY AS BRIDGE.** Same replacement obligation as Patch 19 |
| 21 | Transient accept errors are tolerated (log, delayed re-arm, per-lane consecutive-failure limit) instead of panicking the process (WP90 / F9) | **Yes** — an unauthenticated remote crash: `ECONNABORTED` at accept is peer-triggerable weather, and upstream panics on it | **OFFER UPSTREAM.** The persistence limit is the honest part: a listener that can never accept again stays fatal rather than a silent outage |
| 22 | Detached-stream hooks: chunked heading commit, request-cycle finish after the terminator, unflushed abort (WP90b) | **No** — streaming is Uruquim's Phase-7 capability; upstream's own `Response_Writer` covers the handler-synchronous case only | **CARRY AS BRIDGE.** Deletable with the adapter; the ADR-033 replacement must pass the same wire corpus |
| 23 | Streaming inbound body: deliver a request body one bounded window at a time (Content-Length windowed, chunked per-chunk), reclaiming the consumed buffer prefix so a body of any size costs one window, not its length (WP7.5-C1) | **No** — the read-side twin of Patch 22; streaming ingestion is Uruquim's Phase-7.5 large-body capability, not a defect upstream shares (upstream materializes the whole body) | **CARRY AS BRIDGE.** Deletable with the adapter; the ADR-033 replacement must expose an equivalent incremental body reader and pass the `wp7_5-c1-inbound-stream` corpus |

**Twelve of twenty-three are or contain upstream bugs; the rest are deliberate divergences.** WP70's
multi-lane lifecycle correction joins the upstream group; WP59's absolute drain
deadline joins the policy group. The bridge label changes expected lifetime,
not the evidence or upstream-offer obligation.

Previously, **four of eight were upstream bugs; four were deliberate divergences.** WP47's
admission bound joined the second group: upstream is a general-purpose server
and does not choose a connection limit, while Uruquim does — because a framework
that inherits the kernel's limit has a failure mode it did not choose.

Previously, of seven:
**four of seven were upstream bugs; three were deliberate divergences.** WP45's
keep-alive fix joined the first group and is the plainest of them: a success
path that leaves a failure flag set, breaking persistent connections for every
GET in any application built on this server.

Previously, of six:
**three of six were upstream bugs; three were deliberate divergences.** WP46's
deadline joined the first group: the upstream read path has no deadline at all
and says so in an unfinished-work comment, which makes it a gap in a
general-purpose HTTP server rather than a Uruquim-specific policy.

Originally, of five:
**two of five were upstream bugs; three were deliberate divergences.** That ratio
is the useful number: a snapshot whose patches were all policy would be cheap to
re-vendor, and one whose patches were all bug fixes would argue for upstreaming
everything. This is neither.

### 2.2 The upstream check, run 2026-07-21

Read against `laytan/odin-http` `main` — **which is ahead of the pinned commit**,
so this describes where upstream is going rather than what is vendored here:

* **Patch 2's bug appears FIXED upstream.** The chunked path now reports through
  its error callback (`s.cb(s.user_data, "", err)`) rather than asserting. So
  the patch is likely to become unnecessary at the next re-vendor.
* **Patch 1's bug appears STILL PRESENT.** `_body_length` still uses
  `strconv.parse_int` and validates only the boolean result; the subsequent
  guard is `if max_length > -1 && ilen > max_length`, which a negative `ilen`
  passes. **This one is worth reporting upstream**, because it is a remote
  process kill in a general-purpose HTTP server and not a Uruquim-specific
  concern.

**Recorded as a reading, not as a merge.** It was done from the published source
at a moment in time, and §4's re-check obligation exists because that is all it
is.

---

## 3. Patches are proven by CORPUS, never by grep over vendored source

**The rule, and it is already how the gate works.** WP16 retired the code-shape
greps that asserted patch TEXT and replaced them with executable corpus cases,
for a reason that generalises:

> **A correct re-application of a patch, written differently, must still pass.**

A grep for the patched line fails when someone re-applies the same fix with a
different variable name — which punishes the correct action. Worse, it passes
when someone preserves the line and breaks the behaviour around it.

So:

* **`tests/support/transport_conformance/corpus.odin` is the evidence for the
  five framing patches.** Each has a named case that FAILED before its patch
  existed.
* **AMENDED BY WP46, and the amendment matters.** Patch 6's evidence is NOT in
  the wire corpus — it is in `tests/wp41-fault`, because a deadline is a claim
  about TIME and the wire corpus sends bytes and reads a reply. A corpus of
  byte sequences cannot express "and then nothing happened for a while".
  **The rule is therefore an EXECUTABLE case, not specifically a corpus case**;
  the corpus is the right instrument for framing and the wrong one for
  deadlines, and pretending otherwise would have produced a case that tested
  nothing in order to satisfy a sentence.
* **The gate asserts COVERAGE, not text.** Deleting a case is caught
  statically; reverting a patch is caught by the run.
* **A new patch ships with its executable case in the same change.** A patch
  whose necessity is not demonstrated by a failing case is an opportunistic
  edit, and §5 forbids those.

---

## 4. Who watches upstream, and how often

**The obligation is on the phase gate, not on a person's memory.** Naming a
human here would be inventing a maintainer this project does not have.

* **At every phase freeze**, the vendored provenance is re-checked: is the
  pinned commit still the intended one, have any carried patches been fixed
  upstream, and has the upstream API moved in a way that would make re-vendoring
  expensive? The answers are recorded in the freeze document.
* **A carried patch that upstream has fixed is DROPPED at the next re-vendor**,
  and its corpus case stays — the case proves the behaviour, whoever implements
  it. Patch 2 is the first candidate.
* **Between freezes there is no watch, and this policy says so** rather than
  implying a vigilance nobody is performing. A dependency pinned by commit does
  not change under you; the risk of not watching is staleness, not surprise, and
  staleness is what the freeze check is for.

---

## 5. The rules a patch must satisfy

1. **Security-motivated or ownership-motivated only.** No opportunistic edits,
   no style, no "while I was in there".
2. **Marked at its site** with `URUQUIM PATCH` and the decision it implements.
3. **Covered by an EXECUTABLE case in the same change**, which failed before
   it — the raw-wire corpus for framing, the fault laboratory for anything
   about time. See §3.
4. **Listed in `vendor/odin-http/VENDOR.md`** with its conceptual change and
   its reason.
5. **Minimal.** The smallest edit that produces the behaviour, because every
   line diverged is a line to re-apply at the next re-vendor.
6. **Offered upstream, or recorded as a deliberate divergence.** §2.1's table
   gains a row.

**A patch that cannot satisfy 3 is not a patch, it is a preference.**

---

## 6. What this policy does NOT do

* **It does not decide whether to keep the dependency.** That is ADR-033, open,
  decided at WP41's evidence plus WP46's containment result. This policy governs
  patches whichever way that goes — and if Uruquim ever owns the connection
  layer, §3's corpus rule is exactly what makes the second adapter provable.
* **It does not promise upstream contribution.** §2 offers; it cannot merge.
* **It does not schedule a re-vendor.** A pin is a decision, and moving it is a
  work package with a gate run behind it, not maintenance.

---

## 8. Bridge patches — added 2026-07-21 (ADR-033 Amendment 1)

**A new patch class, and it exists because the foundation now has an expiry
date.** Odin's standard library gains an official `core:net/http` in **January
2027**. ADR-033 Amendment 1 records the consequence: owning the connection layer
is economically dead, and this project keeps patching a vendored server only
until the swap.

That makes some patches *bridges* rather than maintenance. A bridge patch:

1. **Closes a gap that is real today** and cannot wait for January.
2. **Is expected to be deleted** when the new adapter lands — not migrated, not
   ported, deleted.
3. **Is marked `URUQUIM PATCH — BRIDGE`** at its site, so a reader in 2027 knows
   the difference between a patch that carries a security fix forward and one
   that exists because the calendar did not cooperate.
4. **Is offered upstream anyway**, under §2. A bridge for this project may be a
   permanent fix for someone else's, and the rule against carrying unofferred
   patches does not relax because we plan to leave.

**The distinction matters for the wrong reason it could be abused.** "It is a
bridge" is not a licence for a rougher patch. A bridge that ships a knob which
does not bound what it claims is exactly the failure Phase 4 refused when it
withdrew `max_drain_time` — and the withdrawal, not the shipping, was the
correct call. Bridge patches meet the same bar as every other: an executable
case that failed before, a `URUQUIM PATCH` marker, and a recorded upstream
offer.

**First patches in this class:** the Phase-5 drain work (WP59) against
`vendor/odin-http/{server,scanner}.odin`. They exist because `web.stop` cannot
bound itself today, and `git diff --stat` against `vendor/` is the number that
goes into ADR-033's containment verdict.
