# Open Questions

Status: **MIXED, refreshed by WP66 on 2026-07-21.** The Phase-1 questions remain
as history. Current implementation-blocking questions are explicitly owned by
the Phase-6/7 specs: Handler liveness (OQ-29), driver selection (OQ-30),
optional/PATCH representation (OQ-31) and bidirectional streaming lifecycle
(OQ-32). An open question without an owning WP is not permission to improvise.

## Critical (block a WP)

### OQ-1 · RESOLVED — pinned toolchain runs locally and on the VPS
- **Owner.** toolchain owner.
- **Evidence.** Local dev execution on `dev-2026-07-nightly:819fdc7` is complete:
  first run 5/9, corrected second run 9/9, and the extended handler suite
  10/10. The SHA/commit-verified distribution is persistent at
  `/opt/uruquim-odin` on the Ubuntu VPS, and clean commit `4ae2d1c` passed its
  systemd verifier. odin-http vendoring remains a separate WP8 concern.
- **Deadline.** closed before WP1.

### OQ-2 · RESOLVED — drop `#optional_ok` on HTTP extractors
- **Owner.** API owner.
- **Evidence.** exp-04 diagnostic (does the plain-form discard error read
  clearly?).
- **Deadline.** before WP5.
- **Decision.** drop it; the compiler-enforced result count is the safety
  guarantee. Call sites remain `(value, ok)`.

### OQ-3 · RESOLVED — fixed body cap + minimal 405 in Phase 1'
- **Owner.** product owner.
- **Evidence.** scope-review §contested; cost is a body-cap constant in the
  adapter + a 405 branch in the dispatcher (both cheap).
- **Deadline.** before WP4/WP7.
- **Decision.** fixed 4 MiB cap and minimal 405 with required `Allow` header.
  Configurable limits and timeouts remain Phase 3.

### OQ-4 · RESOLVED — `error.field` optional and omitted
- **Owner.** API owner.
- **Evidence.** audit A10; which errors carry a field.
- **Deadline.** before WP6.
- **Decision.** optional, omitted when absent (never `""`/`null`).

### OQ-5 · RESOLVED — `app()` by value is canonical
- **Owner.** API owner.
- **Evidence.** exp-01.
- **Deadline.** before WP1 freeze.
- **Decision.** yes, with no self-pointer before return and no copying or
  destroying copies. `app_init` remains future Advanced API.

### OQ-6 · RESOLVED — nil/wrong app-state is programmer error
- **Owner.** API owner.
- **Evidence.** exp-05.
- **Deadline.** before Phase-3 typed-state WP.
- **Decision.** `app_with_state` rejects nil; `state` asserts registration and
  exact type. This remains future Phase-3/Advanced scope.

### OQ-14 · RESOLVED BASELINE — Phase-1 JSON payloads are values
- **Owner.** API owner.
- **Evidence.** exp-02: `User`/`Big` values marshal; `^User` and proc values
  return `Unsupported_Type` on commit `819fdc7`; stdlib source explicitly
  rejects `runtime.Type_Info_Pointer` except its JSON `Null` sentinel.
- **Deadline.** before WP1 response signature freeze / WP6.
- **Decision.** canonical payloads are values. Docs explicitly reject
  `&value` and pointer-typed variables. Marshal rejection must be logged on
  the server before one complete pre-commit `internal_error`.
- **Non-blocking WP6 follow-up.** Prototype one-level pointer dereference. If
  clean, propose a spec amendment; if not, keep value-only.

### OQ-15 · Repeated `web.body` call semantics
- **Owner.** WP7 / API owner.
- **Evidence required.** Disposable pinned-toolchain prototype covering a
  successful first bind, invalid first bind, empty body, and a second bind;
  demonstrate that the selected diagnostic cannot double-commit.
- **Deadline.** before WP7 production implementation.
- **Proposed direction.** ADR-012 option A: a request body has one canonical
  typed consumer. Do not infer replay merely because Phase 1 buffers input.

## Non-critical (deferred, no WP blocked)

### OQ-7 · Onion vs pre-order middleware
Deferred to the **Phase-2 gate** (ADR-005). Evidence exp-07 gathered; no
Phase-1 impact.

### OQ-8 · Threading model of handlers
**CLOSED by Phase 6 (ADR-030 Amendment 1, WP72).** Bounded multi-lane
synchronous serving is accepted: automatic 4..32, explicit `1` compatibility,
exact 2..256. One lane failed independent-request liveness; four retained it
through three blockers, and the combined race/shutdown/Phase-5 corpus passed.
Full saturation and permanently stuck foreign code remain explicit bounds.

### OQ-9 · Path *string* extractor: empty vs missing
`path_int` is covered (exp-09). The empty-vs-missing semantics of a raw
`path(ctx,name) -> string` needs one test in WP5; low risk. Deferred to WP5
detail, not a gate blocker.

### OQ-10 · Configurable body limit / timeouts (Advanced API)
Phase-3/Advanced. Phase 1' at most ships a fixed cap (OQ-3).

### OQ-11 · Validation story (tags vs explicit vs codegen)
**Owned by Phase 6 WP81.** Explicit transport-free validation is the canonical
arm. The WP must distinguish absent, null, zero and value for PATCH, and may
prototype tag checking only if unknown/incompatible tags fail closed. A
mandatory generator or reflection-heavy hot path remains rejected.

### OQ-12 · OpenAPI surface (`Route_Info`)
Future optional layer; still demand-driven after the Phase-5 and Phase-6
amendments. Not part of the Phases 6–8 critical path.

**Noted 2026-07-21, not decided.** Two facts have moved under this question
since it was written, and neither was recorded:

1. **WP34 shipped `web.route(ctx)`**, which returns the registered pattern — and
   `later-phases-plan.md` describes OpenAPI generation as *"a layer over route
   information"*. Some of the information this question asks for now exists.
   `Route_Info` as a **type** still does not exist anywhere in the tree.
2. **OpenAPI keeps the demand-driven gate.** ADR-034's waiver named static
   files, CORS and uploads, and explicitly not this. So the question stays open
   on purpose: it is no longer blocked on missing information, only on a real
   request.

Recorded because this is the thinnest entry in the file and the one most changed
by work already shipped — an open question nobody revisits is indistinguishable
from a closed one.

### OQ-13 · Collection name (`uruquim:web`) final?
Chosen; confirm in WP0. Trivial to change before 1.0.

### OQ-16 · Trusted proxy policy
Phase-4 security gate (ADR-013). Default remains connected-peer only; no
forwarding header is trusted before the ADR and corpus are accepted.

### OQ-17 · Graceful drain definition
Phase-4 prototype using test transport and one real adapter must define
admission stop, in-flight work, absolute deadline, forced close, and exactly-once
cleanup before an ADR is proposed.

### OQ-18 · Public route-pattern accessor — CLOSED, 2026-07-20 (WP34)
**Answered: `web.route(ctx)` ships, and returns the registered pattern.** The
use case arrived with the observability work: WP20 gave an OBSERVER the route
identity, and an application that wanted to label its own metrics, logs or
spans by route had no way to obtain the same string — `ctx.request.path` is
precisely the wrong substitute, because route identity must be low-cardinality
(C-2). One symbol, ledger 44 → 45, approved under the ADR-029 delegation and
recorded as Amendment 10 of `planning/phase-1-freeze.md`.

The redaction rule travelled with it: the PATTERN, never the path, enforced by
a gate assertion on every write to the slot rather than by convention.

### OQ-19 · Adaptive overload policy
Deferred until deterministic bounded admission and shedding work independently.
Signals, thresholds, hysteresis, and recovery remain research.

### OQ-20 · Multipart temporary-file ownership
Phase 4. Prototype cleanup, quotas, persistence transfer, disk-full, timeout,
and disconnect behavior before proposing an ownership ADR.

**Promoted to blocking, 2026-07-21 (Phase 5, WP62).** Uploads moved into the
core by ADR-034, and this question is its precondition rather than its footnote:
WP62 answers all seven — owner of the temporary file, cleanup, quotas,
persistence, disk-full, timeout, mid-upload disconnect — **before** WP63 writes
a parser. If any answer requires streaming, because a 2 GB upload does not fit
in a buffered body (ADR-014), **WP63 is declined this phase and the reason is
recorded**. A package that records why it could not be built is a criterion met;
one that ships a knob that lies is not.

Second constraint, from ADR-033 Amendment 1: whatever ownership model WP62 fixes
must still hold when the body arrives from `core:net/http` in January 2027. The
parser consumes `[]u8` and never reads from a socket.

**Phase-5 answer, 2026-07-21.** WP62/WP63 selected no temporary file for the
shipped API: `Uploaded_File` is a request-lifetime view into the bounded,
fully-buffered body. Cleanup is arena teardown and a body above
`Limits.max_body` is refused. This closes OQ-20 for `form_file`; it does not
pretend that a 2 GB upload is possible.

**Amendment 1, owned by Phase 7 WP85/WP93.** The new opt-in large-body path has
a different ownership problem and must answer generated filename, permissions,
per-upload/concurrent/process quota, disk-full, timeout, disconnect, shutdown,
crash remnants and explicit persistence transfer before spool code ships. The
buffered answer remains unchanged and is the compatibility oracle.

**Formalized 2026-07-23 (WP85).** The answers are pre-registered in
`phase-7-spec.md` §4.2 — every item above has a threshold or refusal rule
fixed before spool code exists. WP93 commits the RED corpus against those
answers; changing one after seeing a result requires a dated spec amendment.

## Added after the Phase-1 freeze (post-Phase-1 audit)

None of these blocks Phase-2 planning. Each names the work package that will
decide it. **No decision below is accepted** — they are recorded so that the
owning WP does not rediscover them.

| OQ | Question | Recommended direction | Decided by | Owner approval? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-21 | How does test-support grow so a JSON body can be tested in memory? | an explicit Odin procedure group `test_request :: proc{...}`, matching how `core:strings`/`core:net` add variants without creating a second name | first Phase-2 WP that needs it | **yes** — the test-support ledger grows beyond 2 |
| OQ-22 | Onion (post-`next`) middleware, or pre-order only? | prototype both on the bootstrap transport before choosing; the fit audit flags post-`next` as a foreign-abstraction risk | Phase-2 prototype WP | **yes** — it sets the shape of everything after it |
| OQ-23 | Should `Recorded_Response` ever carry headers? | not yet; needed for CORS, cookies and cache validators, which are all Phase 4 | Phase-4 WP that needs it | yes |
| OQ-24 | Configurable limits: an options struct with a package default constant, or individual setter procedures? | the options-struct shape, on `core:net`'s `DEFAULT_TCP_OPTIONS` precedent | Phase-3 limits WP | yes |
| OQ-25 | Does the framework ever terminate TLS, or is reverse-proxy termination the documented deployment? | document proxy termination as the supported path; treat in-process TLS as an optional package at most | Phase-4 spec gate | **yes** — materially changes Phase-4 scope |
| OQ-26 | What is the supported-Odin-version policy, given the pin is a nightly and `core:os` is mid-redesign in that very build? | state a single pinned version as the contract and re-pin deliberately | Phase-2 documentation WP | yes |
| OQ-27 | Does `ops/ci` stay, or move to `tools/`? | left open by the local cleanup plan | Phase-2 housekeeping WP | no |
| OQ-28 | Which licence? | MIT matches the vendored dependency and is lowest-friction | corrective PR, before Phase 2 | **yes** — cannot be defaulted by an agent |
| OQ-29 | Does bounded multi-lane synchronous serving preserve independent-request liveness without breaking framework safety? | prototype four lanes, keep one-lane on any safety ambiguity | WP69–WP72 | **yes** — ADR-030 Amendment 1 |
| OQ-30 | Which PostgreSQL implementation arm can meet secure auth, TLS, cancellation, bounded framing and maintainable ownership? | select by the WP74 contract and wire lab; do not assume a new driver is free | WP74–WP75 | yes, delegated by the Phase-6 spec |
| OQ-31 | What are the canonical nullable and PATCH-state types? | one optional type for none/value and a distinct absent/null/value representation where PATCH needs three states | WP81 | yes, exact names remain gated |
| OQ-32 | Can response streaming and large-body spool share one private lifecycle without imposing a second Handler model? **IN EXECUTION since 2026-07-23:** WP85's spec is merged and WP86 runs the two scheduled evidence questions (`phase-7-spec.md` §6.2). **WP86 evidence answer: yes** (`phase-7-streaming-evidence.md` §3 — candidate C + bounded spool share the private lifecycle; the only arm needing a second Handler model, H, is held to the Advanced bar). Final closure with the implementation, at WP101 | prototype both directions; keep buffered request/response canonical and expose only the minimum transport-owned concepts | Phase 7 WP85–WP94 | yes, program approved; signatures not approved |


## OQ — request-scoped typed state — CLOSED, 2026-07-20 (ADR-028, WP37)

**Answered: it does not exist, and it is not scheduled.** A middleware cannot
hand a typed value to a handler, and the canonical auth pattern pays for it —
`current_user` revalidates the token on every call. **That cost is permanent
until an ADR decides otherwise**, and `build/check_examples.sh` rejects a
comment that schedules its removal.

**This was never ADR-004,** and the conflation is what made the question worth
tracking separately. ADR-004 accepted `web.state` for APPLICATION state — one
`rawptr`+`typeid` on the App, set before serving — which WP37 shipped.
Per-request values have a different lifetime and a different owner, and
treating them as one produced a false promise in shipped documentation that had
to be corrected under G-08.

Research finding C-6 is the substance of the answer: Go's `context.WithValue`
and Rust's `http::Extensions` exist for type-erased, dynamically-keyed state
crossing library boundaries, which Uruquim does not have — so the finding
SUPPORTS G-03 rather than challenging it. ADR-028 accepted option 1 and placed
the burden of proof on reopening: the evidence must be **a real program that
cannot be written cleanly in this tree**, never a hypothetical. Option 1 is
also the only reversible arm — adding a mechanism later is a pure
strengthening, while shipping one and withdrawing it breaks applications at
compile time with no deprecation window that helps.
